### Phase 3: Drafting (40% of your time)

#### Writing Your First Draft
- **Goal**: Get your ideas down on paper
- **Don't worry about**: Perfect grammar, elegant prose, perfect word choice
- **Focus on**: Getting all your ideas and evidence down in order
- **Strategy**: Write quickly, don't edit as you go

#### Introduction Strategies
1. **Start with a question**: "What does it mean to lose your voice while finding it?"
2. **Begin with a quote**: Use a powerful line from the text
3. **Open with context**: "In 2020, the murder of George Floyd..."
4. **Start with contradiction**: "Although Starr feels powerless, she actually..."

#### Body Paragraph Development
- Start each paragraph with a clear topic sentence
- Include 2-3 pieces of evidence per paragraph
- Spend more words on analysis than on evidence
- Use transitions to connect ideas within and between paragraphs

#### Strong Analysis Questions
- Why did the author choose this specific word/image/technique?
- How does this connect to the larger theme?
- What would be different if the author had made a different choice?
- How does this affect the reader's understanding?

### Phase 4: Revising (15% of your time)

#### Global Revision Checklist

- [ ] Does each body paragraph support your thesis?
- [ ] Is your evidence relevant and sufficient?

- [ ] Are your transitions clear and effective?
- [ ] Does your conclusion add something new to your argument?

#### Paragraph-Level Revision
- [ ] Does each paragraph have one main idea?
- [ ] Are your topic sentences clear and specific?
- [ ] Do you have enough analysis for each piece of evidence?
- [ ] Are your quotes properly integrated?

#### Sentence-Level Revision
- [ ] Vary your sentence structure
- [ ] Eliminate wordiness
- [ ] Use active voice when possible
- [ ] Choose precise, specific words

### Phase 5: Editing (5% of your time)

#### Proofreading Checklist

- [ ] Read aloud to catch awkward sentences
- [ ] Check for common errors:
  - Comma splices
  - Fragment sentences
  - Subject-verb disagreement
  - Pronoun antecedent problems
- [ ] Verify all citations are correct
- [ ] Check formatting requirements

## Academic Writing Style

### Formal Academic Tone
#### ✅ Use:
- Third person perspective
- Present tense when discussing literature
- Precise, specific language
- Literary terminology when appropriate

#### ❌ Avoid:
- First person ("I think," "I believe")
- Casual language ("The book is really good")
- Contractions ("don't," "can't")
- Overly emotional language

### Sample Academic Sentences
**Weak**: "The book shows that racism is bad."
**Strong**: "Through Starr's internal conflict, Thomas demonstrates how systemic racism forces young Black Americans to fragment their identities to survive."

**Weak**: "This quote proves my point."
**Strong**: "This dialogue reveals the psychological toll of code-switching on adolescent identity formation."

## Working with Sources

### Integrating Quotes Effectively

#### The Quote Sandwich Method:
1. **Set up the quote** (context)
2. **Present the quote** (with citation)
3. **Analyze the quote** (what it means for your argument)

#### Example:
**Setup**: As Starr navigates the police roadblock with her mother, her father's survival lessons resurface.
**Quote**: Thomas writes, "Keep your hands visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to" (165).
**Analysis**: The imperative mood and parallel structure of these instructions reveal how Black parents must transform love into lessons for survival, turning basic human movements into potential acts of resistance or submission.

### Citation Guidelines (MLA Style)
- In-text citations: (Author Page#)
- For first mention: (Thomas 165)
- For subsequent mentions: (165)
- No page number needed for poems or single-page sources

## Common Essay Types in ENGL 1110

## Time Management Tips

### For a 1-week assignment:
- Day 1-2: Pre-writing and planning

- Day 6: Revising
- Day 7: Editing and final preparation

### For busy schedules:
- Break writing into 30-minute sessions
- Write during your most alert hours
- Use commute time for brainstorming
- Set specific, small goals ("write one paragraph today")

## Getting Unstuck

### When you have writer's block:
1. **Freewrite** for 10 minutes without stopping
2. **Talk through** your ideas with someone
3. **Change locations** - try writing somewhere new
4. **Read examples** of similar essays
5. **Start in the middle** - skip the introduction for now

### When you're stuck on analysis:
- Ask "So what?" after each point
- Consider multiple interpretations
- Think about author's choices and alternatives
- Connect to broader themes or contemporary issues
