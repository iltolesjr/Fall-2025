## Quote Integration Examples

### Poor Integration:
"Starr is scared. 'Keep your hands visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to' (165)."

### Good Integration:
"During the police roadblock, Starr's childhood training surfaces as she remembers her father's survival instructions: 'Keep your hands visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to' (165). This internal dialogue reveals how Black families must prepare children for potentially lethal encounters with law enforcement."

### Excellent Integration:
"The simple, imperative sentences of Maverick's survival instructions—'Keep your hands visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to' (165)—echo through Starr's mind during the roadblock scene, their rhythmic urgency revealing how such lessons become internalized mantras for survival in a world where Blackness itself is perceived as threat."

### ✅ Do:
- Analyze HOW the author creates meaning
