# Essay & Discussion Outlines + Ready-to-Use Chat Prompts

Purpose: Give you reusable skeletal outlines for each major writing task AND professional, constraint-heavy prompt scripts you can paste into ChatGPT (or any AI) so it produces structured drafts that match your course standards without overusing personal narrative or inventing quotes.

> IMPORTANT: Always insert your own real textual fragments. Instruct the AI to use placeholders like [QUOTE 1: code-switch fragment] so you stay accurate and avoid fabricated lines.

## 1. Personal Story Theme Inventory (Pick & Deploy Strategically)
| Story Theme (You Control Details) | Best Placements | Function | Caution |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| Code-switching moment at school | Week 5 Discussion; Comparative Essay intro; Research hook | Establish ethos on linguistic survival | Keep brief (<3 sentences) |
| Media misrepresentation of someone you knew / community event | Gatekeeping discussion; Research Essay; Essay 2 | Shows stakes of narrative control | Avoid naming individuals |
| Family safety conversation about protest / exposure | Safety vs Activism angle; Essay 2 bridge | Frames activism as negotiated | Don’t over-dramatize; focus on decision-making |
| Silence as strategic self-protection | Discussion question endings; Research lens | Complicates “voice = always speak” | Clarify silence ≠ apathy |
| Policing or authority encounter (linguistic filtering) | Code-switch claim; Research hook | Connects diction control to systemic risk | Do not overload with traumatic detail |
| Micro-editing word choice to appear “non‑threatening” | Craft analysis (tone); Essay 1 intro sentence | Links textual register shifts to lived calibration | Keep to 1–2 sentences |
| Witnessing selective quoting / headline framing | Gatekeeping claim; Research Q formation | Illustrates framing economy | Avoid speculation—stick to observable change |

## 2. Week 5 Discussion Post Outlines (Two Angles)
### A. Safety vs Activism Discussion (≈275 Words)
1. Hook (tension snapshot)  
2. Claim (mechanism + meaning)  
3. Scene Micro-Moment #1 (fragment <10 words) → HOW (dialogic friction / pause) → WHY (familial risk calculus)  
4. Scene Micro-Moment #2 (register contrast / interior vs exterior) → build escalation  
5. Synthesis (reframe “finding voice” as negotiated, not instantaneous)  
6. Open Question (asks peers to locate another protective hesitation)  
7. Optional 2-sentence anecdote earlier between steps 1–3 (pivot back with: “This sharpens how…”)  

### B. Media Gatekeeping Discussion (≈275 Words)
1. Hook (personal headline / framing recognition)  
2. Claim (gatekeeping mechanism + cost)  
3. Mechanism #1: Label narrowing (fragment) → analysis  
4. Mechanism #2: Paraphrase compression or question reframing (fragment) → analysis  
5. Witness Cognitive Labor → interior correction vs public version  
6. Synthesis: Narrative control = sequencing + lexical power  
7. Open Question: invites peers to identify anticipatory self-editing moment

## 3. Essay 1 (Literary Analysis) Outline (Target 900–1100 Words)
| Section | Purpose | Contents |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Intro (120–150) | Frame + narrow | 1-sentence context; optional 1-sentence positional lens; transition to interpretive tension; thesis (mechanism → effect → theme) |
| Body 1 (170–190) | Primary craft mechanism | Topic sentence naming mechanism; setup micro-scene; quote fragment (<12 words) + close reading (diction/syntax); interpretive turn |
| Body 2 (170–190) | Second mechanism (progression) | Contrast or evolution; fragment; analysis; connect to thesis nuance |
| Body 3 (Optional) | Complexity / countertexture | Address apparent contradiction; resolve by refining claim |
| Style Pivot (Short) | Show stakes | 2–3 sentences linking craft to broader thematic implication |
| Conclusion (110–140) | Synthesis not repetition | Rephrase thesis at higher abstraction; name consequence; optional 1-sentence positional resonance |

Thesis Formula: "Thomas’s use of [craft mechanism 1] alongside [mechanism 2] reframes [surface issue] as [deeper conceptual claim] by [action phrase describing textual effect]."

---
## 4. Essay 2 (Comparative) Outline Options
### Pattern A: Point-by-Point (Recommended for clarity)
1. Intro (context both texts / lens / comparability rationale / thesis)  
2. Point 1: Mechanism X in Text A vs Text B → interpretive synthesis  
3. Point 2: Escalation / divergence  
4. Point 3: Convergence or irreducible difference (complicates oversimplified link)  
5. Implication: What combined reading reveals about theme (voice, witness, etc.)  
6. Conclusion: Transferable insight + brief positional reflection (if used)  

### Pattern B: Text-by-Text (Use only if differences are stark)
1. Intro  
2. Text A craft + thematic arc  
3. Text B craft + thematic arc (explicit signposts)  
4. Comparative Synthesis (line up mechanisms; evaluate)  
5. Implication / Conclusion  

Comparative Thesis Template: "While [Text A] deploys [mechanism] to present [concept] as [characterization], [Text B] extends/complicates this by [mechanism], suggesting that together they reveal [synthesized claim]."

## 5. Research Essay (Later) Skeleton
| Stage | Function | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Hook Anecdote (100 max) | Stake vividness | Tight, sensory + pivot to systemic question |
| Context Frame | Situate issue | Neutral summary of objective scope (stats) |
| Research Question | Guide inquiry | Open ("How does … influence …?") |
| Working Claim / Hypothesis | Provisional answer | Mechanism-based, not moral judgment |
| Body Section Set | Thematic clusters | e.g., Rhetorical framing / Cognitive labor / Outcome disparities |
| Counter / Limitation | Prevent overreach | Acknowledge alternate interpretation |
| Conclusion | Synthesis + forward look | Application / next research angle |

## 6. Portfolio Reflection Paragraph Skeleton (Later)
1. Opening: What skill evolved (e.g., transforming raw reaction into craft-based claim)  
2. Illustration: Before vs after (brief contrast)  
3. Mechanism Awareness: How noticing diction/syntax shaped revisions  
4. Identity / Positionality Link: How lived experience refined reading—not replaced analysis  
5. Forward Goal: Specific next craft target  

---
## 7. Peer Reply Outline (≈110 Words)
1. Acknowledge analytical center (not generic praise)  
2. Extend: Add different scene OR nuance mechanism  
3. Reframe: Offer alternative function for their cited moment  
4. Question: Invite micro-level craft clarification  
5. Close: Return to their thesis with sharpened lens  

Template: "Your focus on [mechanism] clarifies how the scene manages [effect]. Adding the moment when [additional fragment] intensifies your claim because [mini-analysis]. Could the clipped syntax there signal [alternate function]? Where else do you see that structural pattern?"

---
## 8. Anecdote Insertion Mini-Formula
SNAPSHOT (1 line) → INTERPRETIVE VERB ("taught me / made visible") → PIVOT (“This primes me to notice…”) → TEXTUAL MECHANISM (“Thomas’s shift from ___ to ___”). Total: 2–3 sentences.

---
## 9. Claim Polishing Checklist
| Check | If Missing → Fix |
|-------|------------------|
| Names a craft mechanism | Add term (syntax compression / register shift / narrative framing) |
| States effect on reader or meaning | Add phrase: "…positioning the reader to…" |
| Connects to thematic abstraction | Add higher-level noun (surveillance, testimony, agency) |
| Avoids plot summary verbs | Replace “shows” with “constructs,” “reframes,” “leverages” |

## 11. Safety vs Activism vs Gatekeeping (Clarification)
| Term | What It Refers To | NOT | Core Analytical Focus |
|------|-------------------|-----|----------------------|
| Safety vs Activism | Internal, family-centered negotiation about timing & exposure risk | Simple “speak vs be silent” morality | How relational love + risk assessment shape voice emergence |
| Media Narrative Gatekeeping | External institutional framing (labels, question strategies, paraphrase compression, sequencing) | Withholding info for personal safety (that’s internal caution) | How platforms pre-format moral categories & force witness cognitive labor |
| Withholding for Safety | Intentional delay / limiting detail to protect self/family | Media distortion | Agency in controlling pacing of disclosure |
