Before they erase it, I need to know. Crawling through time in Cooter, Missouri, conversing with my ancestors. I was born in East St. Louis, IL, and grew up in Queens, New York, moving there around 1991. At PS 132 and PS 134 in Springfield Gardens, we all had assembly, and we pledged allegiance to the flag of the United States of America. Hulk Hogan was one of my heroes. This one boy said my new hat was corny; I'll never forget that. We learned Swahili, and we remember the second day because it has a funny name: Kujichagulia. My paternal grandmother died right when I started doing genealogy. What's helped me is not believing what anybody tells me, plus my obsession with problem-solving or stressing myself out. After investigating the murder of my maternal grandmother, Willieva Johnson, I see a record of her son and a city councilman's son who murdered a cab driver for about $100. Almost exactly 90 days later, Ray Williams shoots her three times, the court papers say, with a shotgun, and 12 men found him not guilty for murdering her. My father used to beat me and make me read. I kind of appreciate it now. I want to tell him, "Thank you," because kids these days are built differently. They're not like us.

My father and his half-brother, his brother that he never got along with. His mom left him with her mom in Caruthersville and moved to New York, I guess after Henry Bess stayed with his wife, I'm guessing. She took Uncle Tommy with her? After finding black babies for sale in Natchez, Mississippi, I like to say I've learned how to tiptoe through records, to proceed with caution. Natchez was the second-worst place. So, I guess at one point, the South could only have a certain amount of slaves, so the husband and wife split them. I see the street "Beat" a lot... Beat 3, Beat 4, with the head of the house, James Johnson, wife Jamie Johnson, son James, James, James Jr., James Sr., Jamie, Jamie, Jamelou, Jamieloub, Boby, oh and my favorite, Little Berry Walker Carter. Pemiscot County, Caruthersville, Cooter, Missouri—they call it the Bootheel. "Bleeding Kansas" happened in that area. I have so many relatives that fought for this country. I wonder what they would do if they were me? So after Willieva was murdered, my mom and her siblings got separated. I found the twins after 40 years, and day two, they realized my mom is Gloria. Gloria's been fighting with everyone everywhere. I told her, "I'm sure your mother would not appreciate how you're treating her children and grandchildren and great-grandbabies." Her father, Walter, was born in Natchez. As soon as I met him, I tried to understand him. Maybe if I triangulate his experience growing up in Natchez, Mississippi, the things you were taught, time since 1870, what the '30s were like, animal instinct down to the Neanderthal, I still don't get it. I don't understand how a grown man can be so, so trifling. Sins of the father. My DNA with Tina shares 1700 cM, so she's been staying with the man that's not her father because our DNA suggests she's my mom's biological sister. Tony was murdered in '97, but I found my auntie Tina because her daughter, Yvonda, did the Ancestry for her. She's in the Air Force. Perfect timing... I had to ask her, "Yall aint gonna to shoot us, are you?"

I don't know who told my Uncle Tommy that my second great-grandmother might be an Ester Toles, but I helped him look. I found Lucinda and 8-year-old Wilma Lee Carter in 1940 in Caruthersville. Because of slavery, on the next block, there's another family with the same names: Mr. and Mrs. Johnny Johnson with their own James Johnson, Jamie Johnson, James, James, James Jr., James Sr., Jamie, Jamie, Jamelou, Jamieloub, Boby, oh and my favorite, Little Berry Walker Carter. So I learned that the enumeration district number will bring me back to those coordinates in time. 1950, Caruthersville, Pemiscot County, Missouri. The first page I see is Ira Lee Walker, my paternal grandfather. Oh, he's married. Oh, that's a baby boy. Possibly a grand-uncle? Next page: Lucinda Carter, Wilma Toles, 18, Betty Toles, 8, about 4, Larry Toles [uncle]. The more I look for Ester, the more I try to prove myself right and wrong. What if something happened to her, and that's why Lucinda said in 1940 Wilma Carter is her daughter? I know we're skeptical of people at our door asking us questions every damn 10 years on the dot, but why did Lucinda say Wilma Toles is now her granddaughter? "But keep looking," Uncle says. I deleted my GEDCOM for the 70-ish time and started over: Ira, Ira, Betty, Wilma, ?Ester, Lucinda Moore. Ira, Ira, Betty, Wilma, ?Ester, Lucinda Moore. Ira, Ira, Betty, Wilma, ?Ester, Lucinda Moore. Ira, Ira, Betty, Wilma, ?, Lucinda Moore.

***FOUND HER**

I found my maternal great-grandmother, Cordie Johnson, she popped up in Mittie James and Louis (sometimes Lewis) Johnson's house in Camden, Ouachita, Arkansas, in 1920, as a 16-year-old girl named Cordie Johnson. This record says Claudia mae Johnson at Magnolia Cemetery in Caruthersville. Her tombstone says Claudia Mae Johnson, born Claudia Mae Cobbs. Now there's only about three records where she sometimes calls herself Cordie Cobbs. I think at birth her name got mixed up. It's always been Claudia, daughter to of Willieva and others. I want to be buried there with them. Maybe I'll buy a lot. If my grandmother is born already and my grandfather is on the next page, which is technically like the next block. .......I told my uncle I can talk to the dead. The dead say the facts point to no Ester Toles, and I know why but why Toles idk. Did my grandma end up doing what her mother did? All these events lined up perfectly for me to be here? I'm a sin baby. What do you, or could you, want from me? All we had was our name: Mrs. Claudia Mae Cobbs, oh, and my Little Berry Walker Carter..................rough draft

THUG LIFE
1 either she was having a flashback or they were renacting a previous interaction. from her parents? thomas switches the reader to first person it feels like. 2. because of the george floyyd protest? because they definatly dont make rappers like that anymore. young jeezy has a vesse that says baby needs food, partna need bail money. i dont know if he was speaking as if not to judge someone until youve been in their shoes or if he was justifying. I dont know the character well enough to decide if he's the type of person that puts money and loyalty and maybe family above everything or Morals,honor and humiliity. i dont know if Maaverick knows that an illegal decision is not always your last decision. I dont know if maverick has the grit to come up with a plan like donating plasma and doing science surveys for extra cash. or going to school full time and working full time with a parttime job as a school tutor or something. I dont know if maverick would jutify selling crack to his mom because you might as well keep the money in the family. The significance would be in him giving that kid a job because he didnt want that kid to go down his early path. I dont know. movies or books always has this corny transition to give you backstory. Usually they do it to show the audience the tone of that memory or flashback. its usually whimslckle with the protaganist alsways wanting to rush through that seen like yeah yeah and what was dad's pimp name back in the 80s kid? the kids in unison willie mac. dad says thats right! The Nat Turner rebellion His own past with gangs and incarceration What is Thomas trying to convey by including this history and personal story in the middle of the chapter? Pages 170–171: What does Maverick say about the history of social injustice? How does this connect to the broader theme of systemic oppression in Black communities? Ending of the Chapter: Starr says, “That’s one more thing one fifteen takes from me” (p. 181). Who is “115”? What does this statement reveal about Starr’s emotional state and the impact of police violence on her family? i want to add that maybe just maybe i could go back in time and stop johnny johnson jr from killing that cab driver then maybe maybe my black ass would have had a better life
