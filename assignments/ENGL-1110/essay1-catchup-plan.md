Student: (Add Name)
Course: ENGL 1110 College Composition

## 1. Situation Snapshot

| Item | Status | Action Needed |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Reading Log 1 (Thomas OR Danticat) | Submitted (per LMS listing) | Skim instructor feedback + extract 2 style notes |
| Reading Log 2 (Jen OR Hijuelos) | Submitted | Pull 1 idea that could connect to mobility/identity for future use |
| Essay 1 Rough Draft (due 9/23) | Not submitted | Draft now (condensed timeline) |
| Essay 1 Final Draft (due 9/26) | Not submitted | Submit polished late version w/ note |
| Upcoming Comparative Essay (Essay 2) | Introduced soon | Build evidence bank while drafting Essay 1 |

## 2. Immediate Priority (Today – Oct 2)

1. Choose primary text: The Hate U Give (Thomas) OR Children of the Sea (Danticat). (If you wrote Reading Log 1 on one, consider using the same to leverage notes.)
2. Draft FAST Thesis (see templates below) – NO summary.
3. Create body paragraph scaffold (3 claims) → plug evidence from text (quote + device + effect).
4. Write full draft (target 900–1100 words if assignment range unknown; adjust later).
5. Run revision checklist (conciseness, analysis > summary, sentence combining, specificity).
6. Write brief Late Submission Note to Instructor (template below) and submit.

## 3. Thesis Templates (Pick & Personalize)

| Focus Lens | Template |
|------------|----------|
| Voice / Identity (HUG) | Through Starr’s shifting code-switching between Garden Heights and Williamson Prep, Thomas dramatizes the psychological pricing of survival while charting a movement from guarded performance to public testimony. |
| Family & Resistance (HUG) | Thomas frames family dialogue and kitchen-table scenes as emotional infrastructure that converts private fear into public activism, showing resistance as relational rather than individual. |
| Silence / Witness (Children of the Sea) | Danticat’s epistolary fragments and unreceived letters expose how political violence erodes communicative circuits, transforming language into elegiac memory-work rather than exchange. |
| Sea Imagery (Children of the Sea) | Recurring oceanic imagery shifts from geographic distance to a metaphor of dissolution, underscoring how exile erases tangible futures while preserving affective traces. |

Refine AFTER picking: Add a “so what” implication (social, ethical, or emotional significance).

## 4. Paragraph Scaffold Model

| Paragraph | Function | Sentence Starters |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Intro | Context (1–2), pivot to analytical frame, thesis last | While (text) opens with … / Rather than simply … the narrative … |
| Body 1 (Technique A) | Claim about technique → evidence → analysis → link | Thomas uses contrasting diction (“…”) to … |
| Body 2 (Technique B) | Build complexity, maybe tension or shift | This tension deepens when … |
| Body 3 (Development / Consequence) | Show progression or transformation | By the climax / final section … |
| Optional Counter / Nuance | Address a possible oversimplification | Although one could argue … |
| Conclusion | Synthesize (NOT repeat) + broader implication | Read together, these choices reveal … |

## 5. Evidence Insertion Checklist

- Introduce: Who is speaking / narrative moment.
- Quote trimmed to essential phrase (≤ 15 words ideally) OR paraphrase.
- Identify device: diction, syntax, symbolism, structure, juxtaposition, point of view.
- Explain function BEFORE meaning: What does it DO rhetorically? THEN why it matters.

## 6. Quick Style Upgrade Moves

| Weak | Upgrade |
|------|---------|
| The author talks about … | The narrative foregrounds / exposes / interrogates … |
| This quote shows … | This moment crystallizes / amplifies / reframes … |
| A lot of | substantial / layered / sustained |
| Very important | structurally pivotal / ethically consequential |

## 7. Revision Pass Order (40-Min Plan)

1. Thesis precision (remove vague nouns, add mechanism). (5m)
2. Topic sentences = CLAIMS (no plot-first openings). (5m)
3. Evidence ratio: ~30% quote/paraphrase vs 70% analysis. (10m)
4. Combine short adjacent sentences (use coordination / subordination / participial openers). (8m)
5. Specific verbs pass (replace says, shows, talks about). (5m)
6. Conclusion synthesis (add implication; remove repetition). (7m)

## 8. Late Submission Note Template

Subject: ENGL 1110 – Essay 1 Late Submission (Request for Acceptance)

Hello [Instructor Name],

I was not able to submit Essay 1 (Literary Analysis) by the Sept 26 deadline. I’ve completed a polished version now and am submitting it today (Oct 1). I focused on [brief thesis focus]. If late penalties apply, I understand and appreciate any consideration for partial credit. I’m also adjusting my workflow using a structured weekly planner to stay current on upcoming comparative essay tasks.

Thank you for your time,
-Ira Toles

## 9. Bridge to Comparative Essay

While drafting, tag each quote with possible comparative themes (e.g., “identity performance,” “witness,” “social cost”). These tags become Column 1 of the future comparison evidence table.

## 10. Mini Evidence Table (Start Filling NOW)

| Tag | Quote (Short) | Device | Function | Potential Comparative Angle |
|-----|---------------|--------|----------|-----------------------------|
| Identity | "(example)" | Diction contrast | Marks dual audience | Code-switching vs. silence |
| Family anchor |  | Dialogue | Emotional scaffolding | Communal vs. isolated voice |
| Public speech |  | Scene framing | Transition to agency | Testimony vs. lost letters |
