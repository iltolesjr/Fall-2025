# Essay 1 — Revision Plan (Lubrano Chapter)

Date: 2025-10-17
Course: ENGL‑1110
Essay: Literary Analysis — Alfred Lubrano chapter

## 1) Instructor feedback (diagnosis → action)
Feedback highlights (paraphrased):

- Strong connection to Lubrano at times; grade-level B when focused (¶8, ¶10).
- 4 of 10 paragraphs (¶3, ¶5, ¶6, ¶7) drift into personal narrative, not analysis of Lubrano.
- “English class” paragraph feels off‑topic → cut.
- Goal: Move from reacting to the reading to analyzing the chapter.

Revision actions:

- Paragraphs to cut or convert:
  - ¶3, ¶5, ¶6, ¶7: Convert personal anecdotes into analytical support for Lubrano’s claims OR compress to 1 short anecdote that functions as evidence. Each must begin and end with Lubrano‑centered claims.
  - English class paragraph: Cut.
- Maintain focus: Every paragraph must have a topic sentence naming Lubrano’s claim, not your experience. Your experience appears only as a brief illustration (2–3 sentences max) that you then interpret through Lubrano.

## 2) Refocused thesis options (pick 1 and adapt)

1) Gatekeeping thesis: Lubrano argues that the middle class runs on invisible rules that reward those who learn them and punish those who don’t; the cost of learning those rules is social, not only economic, and his chapter shows how success often requires leaving people and places behind.
2) Code‑switching thesis: In Lubrano, mobility depends on code‑switching—controlling accent, tastes, and networks—and this performance extracts a “price of admission,” measured in strained relationships and self‑division.
3) Success‑advice critique thesis: Lubrano complicates pop “success” platitudes (change your five closest friends, hustle, brand yourself) by showing the hidden human costs behind those slogans and how they reproduce class boundaries.

Thesis test:

- Can you name 2–3 specific Lubrano passages that directly support it? If not, sharpen the claim.

## 3) Paragraph plan (10 → 8–9 paragraphs)

- Intro (revised thesis)
- Body 1: “Rules” are invisible but enforceable (Lubrano evidence)
- Body 2: Learning rules = code‑switching and self‑monitoring (Lubrano)
- Body 3: Social cost of mobility (friends/family distance) (Lubrano)
- Body 4: Short anecdote reframed as case study that illustrates Lubrano’s claim (2–3 sentences only), then 5–6 sentences of analysis connecting back to Lubrano
- Body 5: Pushback/complexity: limited benefits + cumulative costs (Lubrano)
- Body 6 (optional): Implications—what Lubrano suggests about merit and belonging
- Style pivot: why this matters beyond the text
- Conclusion: return to thesis; name broader significance

Target length: Keep within assignment limit; reduce personal narrative volume.

## 4) Fixes for ¶3, ¶5, ¶6, ¶7 (templates)

Use these as rewrite starters—replace bracketed parts with your language + the Lubrano line you’re using.

- New topic sentence (for each drifting paragraph):
  “As Lubrano shows, [middle‑class mobility depends on learning unspoken rules/performing a new self], a process that [costs relationships or identity].”

- Bridge into anecdote (2–3 lines max):
  “That dynamic appears in miniature in my experience with [WorldVentures / ‘your five closest friends’ advice / Trump–Kiyosaki book]: the network logic demanded that I [change friends/values].”

- Warrant back to Lubrano (analysis → HOW/WHY):
  “Lubrano’s point isn’t that ambition is wrong; it’s that the ‘rules’ require you to police your own habits and ties to be seen as legitimate. The advice to replace friends functions as a rule‑enforcement mechanism, not neutral motivation.”

- Close the paragraph by naming his concept explicitly:
  “In Lubrano’s terms, the ‘cost of mobility’ is paid in [lost ties / code‑switch fatigue], which is why the advice culture he critiques sounds empowering while it reproduces class boundaries.”

Cut directive:

- “English class” paragraph: remove entirely (off‑topic for Lubrano’s claims).

## 5) Analysis > reaction converter

- Swap “I feel/think” with “Lubrano argues/demonstrates/complicates.”
- Convert summary into mechanism: name HOW it works (rule, code‑switch, gatekeeping) and WHY it matters (cost, belonging, legitimacy).
- Minimum unit: Quote fragment (≤ 8 words) or precise paraphrase + analysis (2 moves: HOW, WHY).

Sentence frame:

- “Lubrano writes ‘[micro‑quote]’ ([page]). The verb ‘[keyword]’ signals [mechanism]. This shows that [how it works], which matters because [why it matters] in class mobility.”

Signal verbs: argues, demonstrates, complicates, reveals, exposes, frames, contends, qualifies, distinguishes, contrasts, theorizes.

## 6) Micro‑quote integration (3 steps)

1) Set‑up: context + claim (“Lubrano argues that …”).
2) Quote: ≤ 8 words embedded in your sentence.
3) Unpack 2 moves: HOW (what mechanism), WHY (what consequence/cost).

Example:
“Lubrano calls the expectations ‘[micro‑quote]’ ([page]), a phrase that frames them as rules rather than preferences. Treating them as rules explains why violating them carries social penalties.”

## 7) Evidence map (fill with exact lines/pages you’ll use)

- Rules are invisible but enforced: [quote/page]
- Code‑switching/performing legitimacy: [quote/page]
- Social cost (losing friends/family): [quote/page]
- Complication/limit to mobility: [quote/page]

## 8) Quick revision checklist

- Thesis names Lubrano’s mechanism + cost.
- Every topic sentence mentions Lubrano (not me).
- Personal content ≤ 15% of essay; functions as case evidence.
- Each paragraph: claim → micro‑quote/paraphrase → HOW/WHY analysis → tie‑back to thesis.
- English class paragraph removed.
- Conclusion returns to mechanism + cost and stakes.

## 9) Optional concluding pivot (why it matters)

- If middle‑class rules are invisible, then “motivation” advice can hide rule‑enforcement inside friendly slogans. Lubrano makes that visibility the first ethical step in talking about mobility.
