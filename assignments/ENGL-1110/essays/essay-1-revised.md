When I read Alfred Lubrano's "Bricklayer's Son," I felt like he was writing about my life. He calls people like him "straddlers"—people who do not fully belong in one class or the other. That sense of living between worlds changes how you act and how you are read by others. Lubrano's chapter shows that mobility is not a single success story but a hinge: it demands learning invisible rules to gain access to middle-class legitimacy, and that performance often extracts a cost in belonging and self-recognition.

Lubrano's essay moves in three beats that also track with my story. It begins with the image, "My dad has built lots of places in New York City he can't get into: colleges, condos, office towers," a powerful outside/inside contrast that names exclusion (Lubrano [p. XX]). In the middle he writes, "Being the white-collar child of a blue-collar parent means being the hinge on the door between two ways of life," which frames mobility as constant translation (Lubrano [p. XX]). Toward the end, his mother's double-Dutch memory keeps the rhythm of home even as he moves on, a reminder that habits and values persist across transitions. Together these moments make class spatial, relational, and temporal: exclusion, code-switching, and inherited rhythm.

Lubrano argues that "corporate norms are based on middle- and upper-class values," and that observation explains why some rules feel familiar to insiders and foreign to outsiders (Lubrano [p. XX]). Working-class families often teach the ethic that "hard work pays off," while middle-class families teach how to "make money work for you." The difference is not merely language but legitimacy: corporate and academic spaces recognize one set of practices as neutral and superior. The hinge Lubrano names requires straddlers to translate between two playbooks—one valued by gatekeepers, the other by home—and that translation itself becomes evidence of belonging or not.

Lubrano's term for the "cost of social mobility" helps explain what I saw in a recruitment pitch for a network marketing company: the advice that "the net worth of your five closest friends is your net worth" sounded like self-help, but it operated as a rule-enforcement mechanism, demanding the replacement of existing ties to perform upward mobility. That pressure is exactly the kind of relational price Lubrano describes—belonging becomes conditional on adopting a new script and abandoning the social anchors that once defined you. In that sense, advice that markets mobility as purely individual work obscures the social toll it extracts.

When Lubrano describes the "vocabulary gap" between classes, he is naming a structural disadvantage: not knowing which questions to ask or which protections exist is a form of invisibility (Lubrano [p. XX]). A single uninformed decision—buying a used car without legal advice, signing away protections—can compound into long-term instability. Straddlers learn these rules by failing; insiders inherit them as common sense. The gap Lubrano identifies helps us see how small, everyday choices are shaped by unequal access to knowledge and legal literacy.

Family is where many of these habits pass down. Lubrano writes about how domestic rhythms and practices teach class quietly and persistently. For me, watching my father wear ties after selling cars taught me an unspoken performance of respectability—habits that stick without explanation. That inherited comportment becomes a resource for code-switching: it can signal legitimacy in white-collar spaces even when the interior feeling is displacement.

Lubrano also describes how straddlers face constant evaluation—slurs and microaggressions that police who "belongs" and who is performing class inappropriately (Lubrano [p. XX]). This surveillance functions as gatekeeping: middle-class spaces reward the appearance of native fluency, so every choice (accent, clothing, leisure) becomes evidence in an ongoing legitimacy trial. The cost here is epistemic as well as social: straddlers learn to monitor themselves and doubt their instincts, always wondering if they've misread the rules.

Seeing Lubrano's start, middle, and end together, I hear one message: class is learned early, rewarded differently, and felt deeply. Lubrano's "hinge" metaphor names a structural mechanism—rules, codes, and expectations—that makes mobility possible for some and costly for others. If we see that mechanism clearly, we can stop treating mobility advice as purely individual and start asking who pays the price and why. Naming the hinge is the first step toward living with less shame about the gaps in our fluency and more care for the people on both sides of the door.
