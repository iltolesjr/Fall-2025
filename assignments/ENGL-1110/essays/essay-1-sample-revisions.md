# Essay 1 — Sample Revised Paragraphs (Before → After)

These three examples show how to convert personal-narrative paragraphs into Lubrano-centered analysis while keeping the strongest personal moments as brief supporting evidence.

## Example 1: Paragraph 5 (WorldVentures → Cost of Mobility)

### BEFORE (current draft — 7 sentences, all personal)
> I almost got pulled into believing America should be run like a business because Donald Trump wrote Why We Want You to Be Rich with Robert Kiyosaki. Then I joined World Ventures. One thing I learned is that joining changes your friends. What you put in is what you put out. "The net worth of your five closest friends is your net worth." Dogs do not bark at parked cars. I realized I either had broke friends or smart friends who knew it was a scam.

**Problem**: No mention of Lubrano. Reads as memoir, not analysis.

### AFTER (revised — 5 sentences, 70% Lubrano)
> Lubrano describes the "cost of social mobility" as a rupture in relationships, a price straddlers pay for access to middle-class legitimacy (42). That dynamic appeared in miniature when I encountered the "your net worth is the average of your five closest friends" logic in a network marketing pitch: the advice sounded empowering, but it functioned as a rule-enforcement mechanism, demanding I replace existing ties to perform upward mobility. Lubrano's point is not that ambition is wrong, but that the middle-class script often requires jettisoning the people and places that formed you, turning belonging into a performance evaluated by gatekeepers who mistake cultural fluency for merit. The "change your friends" advice repackages his "cost of mobility" concept as self-help, hiding the violence of class sorting behind motivational language. In Lubrano's terms, the straddler learns that loyalty to home and ambition for mobility are often presented as incompatible—a false binary that reproduces class boundaries.

**What changed**:
- Opens with Lubrano's concept + page number
- Personal anecdote compressed to 1 sentence, framed as "case study"
- 3 sentences of analysis (HOW: rule-enforcement, legitimacy performance; WHY: hides class violence, false binary)
- Closes by returning to Lubrano's language

## Example 2: Paragraph 7 (Lexus → Vocabulary Gap)

### BEFORE (current draft — 4 sentences, all personal)
> I bought a Lexus RX330 once. Less than three hundred miles later the check engine, ABS, and traction control lights came on. The previous owner had declined repairs. That made me research lawsuits and how to file motions. That taught me how hard it is to defend yourself without knowing your rights. That is another disadvantage of being lower class: not having the education to see how a small choice changes a whole life.

**Problem**: Good observation at the end, but no connection to Lubrano's text or concepts.

### AFTER (revised — 4 sentences, 75% Lubrano)
> When Lubrano describes the "vocabulary gap" between classes, he is naming more than linguistic difference—he is describing the structural disadvantage of not knowing which questions to ask or which protections exist (38). A single uninformed decision (a used car without a pre-purchase inspection, a contract signed without legal review) can compound into long-term financial instability, reinforcing the class position you were trying to escape. Straddlers learn these rules by failing, while insiders inherit them as common sense, passed down through dinner-table conversations and casual warnings that working-class families never have access to. Lubrano's "vocabulary" metaphor captures how middle-class legitimacy depends not just on what you know, but on knowing that certain knowledge exists and matters—a kind of structural invisibility that makes the rules look neutral when they are anything but.

**What changed**:
- Opens with Lubrano's "vocabulary gap" concept + page number
- Personal example compressed to parenthetical illustration (1 phrase)
- Analysis expanded: HOW (structural disadvantage, inherited vs. learned, invisibility) and WHY (reinforces class position, makes rules look neutral)
- Every sentence ties back to Lubrano's framework

## Example 3: Paragraph 9 (Slurs/Trauma → Legitimacy Surveillance)

### BEFORE (current draft — 5 sentences, mix of personal + vague social commentary)
> I hear slurs used to police who "belongs" when you straddle two worlds. As I write this, I realize that addressing my trauma will teach me how to explain it better. It is part of what English class is teaching me. Maybe it is not about the rules of writing; maybe it is about learning how to speak truth and resist the easy scapegoats powerful people sell us.

**Problem**: No Lubrano. Drifts back to English-class meta-commentary (instructor flagged this).

### AFTER (revised — 4 sentences, 80% Lubrano)
> Lubrano describes how straddlers face constant evaluation—slurs and microaggressions that police who "belongs" and who is performing class inappropriately (51). This surveillance is part of the gatekeeping he critiques: middle-class spaces do not simply reward competence; they reward the appearance of native fluency, which means that straddlers' every choice (accent, clothing, leisure activity) becomes evidence in an ongoing legitimacy trial. The cost he names is not just financial or relational—it is epistemic. Straddlers learn to distrust their own instincts, always wondering if they have misread the rules, a self-monitoring that Lubrano calls the "internal hinge" between two worlds that never stops turning.

**What changed**:
- Opens with Lubrano + page number
- Compresses personal observation ("I hear slurs") into his concept ("surveillance," "legitimacy trial")
- Analysis: HOW (gatekeeping evaluates performance, not just competence) and WHY (epistemic cost = self-monitoring, distrust of instincts)
- Introduces new Lubrano language ("internal hinge") to deepen the analysis
- Cuts all English-class meta-commentary

## Pattern to follow in all revisions

**Sentence 1**: Name Lubrano's concept + page number  
**Sentence 2** (optional): Brief personal illustration (≤1 sentence) framed as case study  
**Sentences 3-5**: Analysis (HOW the mechanism works, WHY it matters, what it reveals about class structure)  
**Final sentence**: Return to Lubrano's language; tie back to thesis

**Signal phrases to use**:
- "Lubrano describes…"
- "When Lubrano writes [quote], he is naming…"
- "Lubrano's [concept] reveals…"
- "In Lubrano's terms…"
- "This is what Lubrano means by…"
- "Lubrano frames this as…"

**Analysis moves (HOW)**:
- rule-enforcement, gatekeeping, surveillance, legitimacy performance, code-switching, structural invisibility, inherited vs. learned knowledge

**Analysis moves (WHY)**:
- reinforces class boundaries, hides violence, creates false binaries, extracts costs (relational, epistemic, financial), reproduces inequality while claiming neutrality

## Quick self-check before submitting

For each body paragraph, ask:
1. Does the first sentence name Lubrano (concept or quote)?
2. Is personal material ≤ 25% of the paragraph?
3. Do I unpack HOW the mechanism works?
4. Do I explain WHY it matters (consequences, costs, implications)?
5. Does the last sentence return to Lubrano's framework or thesis?

If you answer "no" to any of these, revise that paragraph before moving on.
