- **Connections** between different assignments and your overall growth

### Sample Reflection Excerpt

> When I compare my first literary analysis essay to my revised version, the most significant change is in the depth of my analysis. Originally, I wrote, "Thomas shows that code-switching is hard for Starr" (Essay 1, Draft 1). This sentence tells the reader what happens but doesn't analyze how Thomas creates meaning. In my revision, I wrote, "Through Starr's internal monologue during the police roadblock—'Keep your hands visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to'—Thomas demonstrates how survival strategies become internalized scripts that fragment identity even in moments of supposed safety" (Essay 1, Final). This revision shows how I've learned to move from observation to analysis, examining not just what the author shows but how specific literary techniques create meaning for readers.
