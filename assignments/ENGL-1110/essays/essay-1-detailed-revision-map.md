# Essay 1 Draft — Paragraph-by-Paragraph Revision Map

Date: 2025-10-18
Draft status: Instructor feedback received (B-level when focused; needs refocus on Lubrano)

## Diagnosis: Current 10-paragraph structure

### ¶1 (Intro): **STRONG** — Keep with minor edits
Current: Opens with personal connection, introduces "straddlers" concept, names Lubrano.
Revision: Add explicit thesis at end naming Lubrano's mechanism + cost.

**Current close**: "...you live between worlds, never fully accepted in either, and it changes you."

**Revised close** (choose one):
- Option A: "Lubrano's 'straddlers' concept reveals that class mobility is not a ladder but a hinge: it demands code-switching between two value systems, and that performance extracts a cost in belonging and self-recognition."
- Option B: "In 'Bricklayer's Son,' Lubrano argues that crossing class lines means learning invisible rules that feel natural to insiders and foreign to outsiders, a process that leaves straddlers permanently displaced and constantly performing legitimacy."

---

### ¶2: **STRONG** — Keep, add one micro-quote
Current: Three-beat structure tracks Lubrano's arc (outside/inside, hinge, mother's memory).
Revision: Excellent roadmap paragraph. Add page numbers to quotes and one sentence of analysis.

**Add after the three quotes**:
"These three moments show how Lubrano structures class as spatial (locked out), relational (hinge between worlds), and temporal (rhythms that persist). Each image names a different dimension of displacement."

---

### ¶3 (English class / trauma): **CUT OR RADICALLY REDUCE**
Current: 6 sentences on English class, slavery, Roots, naming trauma.
Instructor note: Off-topic; doesn't analyze Lubrano.

**Two options**:
1) **Cut entirely** (cleanest fix)
2) **Salvage 1 sentence** if you can tie it to Lubrano's concept of "vocabulary gap" or "legitimacy performance":
   - "Lubrano writes that straddlers often lack the vocabulary to name what they experience ([page]). Learning to articulate class displacement—like learning to name any systemic trauma—is part of the work of becoming legible in middle-class spaces."

If you keep anything, it must start and end with Lubrano, not your 8th-grade experience.

---

### ¶4: **GOOD START, needs rebalancing (60% Lubrano / 40% commentary)**
Current: "Working-class kids hear... Middle-class kids hear..." then corporate norms quote.
Revision: Lead with Lubrano's claim, then use the "two playbooks" insight as your analysis.

**Revised version**:
"Lubrano argues that 'corporate norms are based on middle- and upper-class values' ([page]), a structure that rewards those who already know the unspoken rules. Working-class families teach 'hard work pays off'; middle-class families teach 'make money work for you.' Both contain truth, but Lubrano's point is that only one set of rules is recognized as legitimate in corporate and academic spaces. The hinge he describes is epistemological: straddlers must learn to translate between two systems of value, each with different rewards and different costs. When he writes about corporate norms, he is naming the mechanism of exclusion—not individual prejudice, but systemic illegibility."

---

### ¶5 (WorldVentures / Trump-Kiyosaki / "five closest friends"): **DRIFTS — Refocus or cut**
Current: 7 sentences of personal narrative, no return to Lubrano.
Instructor note: Not focused on Lubrano; either cut or connect.

**Revision strategy**: Compress to 2 sentences, frame as case study of Lubrano's "cost of mobility."

**Revised version**:
"Lubrano writes that straddlers experience the 'cost of social mobility' as a rupture in relationships ([page]). That dynamic appeared in miniature when I encountered the 'your net worth is the average of your five closest friends' logic in a network marketing pitch: the advice sounded empowering, but it functioned as a rule-enforcement mechanism, demanding I replace existing ties to perform upward mobility. Lubrano's point is not that ambition is wrong, but that the middle-class script often requires jettisoning the people and places that formed you, turning belonging into a performance evaluated by gatekeepers who mistake cultural fluency for merit."

---

### ¶6 (Friend / strip club / $100): **CUT ENTIRELY**
Current: 3 sentences, no connection to Lubrano.
Instructor note: Distracts from analysis.

**Action**: Remove. If you feel it's essential to your narrative, save it for a personal essay in another course.

---

### ¶7 (Lexus / lawsuits / rights): **DRIFTS — Refocus or cut**
Current: 4 sentences on car purchase, legal research, class disadvantage.
Instructor note: Not focused on Lubrano.

**Revision strategy**: Compress to 2 sentences, tie explicitly to Lubrano's "vocabulary" or "legitimacy" theme.

**Revised version**:
"When Lubrano describes the 'vocabulary gap' between classes ([page]), he is naming more than linguistic difference—he is describing the structural disadvantage of not knowing which questions to ask or which protections exist. A single uninformed decision (a used car without a pre-purchase inspection, a contract signed without legal review) can compound into long-term financial instability, reinforcing the class position you were trying to escape. Straddlers learn these rules by failing, while insiders inherit them as common sense."

---

### ¶8 (Family / ties / father): **GOOD — Keep, expand slightly**
Current: 4 sentences connecting Lubrano's family theme to your father's tie-wearing.
Revision: This is exactly the right use of personal material—brief, illustrative, tied back to Lubrano.

**Expanded version**:
"Lubrano writes about family as the site where class habits are transmitted, often without explicit instruction ([page]). My father wore ties after working in car sales, and that practice stuck with me—not because anyone explained its significance, but because I absorbed it as normal. Lubrano's 'hinge' metaphor captures how these habits function: they are the pivot point where one set of norms (blue-collar pragmatism) meets another (white-collar performance), and straddlers must learn to code-switch without losing the thread of who they were. The tie becomes both a costume and a credential, a signal that you have learned the rules even if you still feel like an outsider."

---

### ¶9 (Slurs / trauma / English class): **DRIFTS — Refocus**
Current: 5 sentences on slurs, trauma, scapegoats, powerful people.
Instructor note: Returns to off-topic English-class reflection.

**Revision strategy**: Cut the English-class framing; keep the "slurs police belonging" observation and tie it to Lubrano's legitimacy theme.

**Revised version**:
"Lubrano describes how straddlers face constant evaluation—slurs and microaggressions that police who 'belongs' and who is performing class inappropriately ([page]). This surveillance is part of the gatekeeping he critiques: middle-class spaces do not simply reward competence; they reward the appearance of native fluency, which means that straddlers' every choice (accent, clothing, leisure activity) becomes evidence in an ongoing legitimacy trial. The cost he names is not just financial or relational—it is epistemic. Straddlers learn to distrust their own instincts, always wondering if they have misread the rules."

---

### ¶10 (Conclusion): **STRONG FOUNDATION — Expand with thesis callback**
Current: "Class is learned early, rewarded differently, and felt deeply. If we see it clearly, we can live with less shame and more care for both sides."
Revision: Beautiful summary. Add explicit return to Lubrano's mechanism and one sentence on stakes/implications.

**Revised version**:
"Seeing Lubrano's start, middle, and end together, I hear one message: class is learned early, rewarded differently, and felt deeply. His 'straddler' concept shows that mobility is not a simple success story but a negotiation between two worlds, each with its own rules and costs. The hinge he describes—'being the white-collar child of a blue-collar parent'—is both structural and personal: it names the systemic illegibility of working-class habits in middle-class spaces, and it names the interior displacement of never fully belonging in either world. If we see this mechanism clearly, as Lubrano does, we can live with less shame about the gaps in our fluency and more care for the people on both sides of the hinge. That visibility, he suggests, is the first step toward a more honest conversation about merit, mobility, and belonging."

## Summary of cuts and compressions

**Cut entirely**:
- ¶3 (English class / slavery / Roots) — off topic
- ¶6 (Friend / strip club) — no connection to Lubrano

**Compress to 2-3 sentences + refocus on Lubrano**:
- ¶5 (WorldVentures) → becomes case study of "cost of mobility"
- ¶7 (Lexus) → becomes illustration of "vocabulary gap"
- ¶9 (slurs / trauma) → becomes analysis of legitimacy surveillance

**Keep and expand**:
- ¶1 (intro) → add explicit thesis
- ¶2 (three-beat structure) → add one analytic sentence
- ¶4 (corporate norms) → rebalance to lead with Lubrano
- ¶8 (father / ties) → expand slightly with code-switching language
- ¶10 (conclusion) → expand with thesis callback

**Result**: 8 paragraphs, ~70-80% Lubrano-focused, personal material functions as brief evidence.

---

## New outline (8 paragraphs)

1. **Intro**: "Straddlers" concept + thesis (mobility as hinge, cost in belonging/legitimacy)
2. **Structure**: Three-beat arc (outside/inside, hinge, rhythm) + what it reveals
3. **Corporate norms**: Invisible rules + two playbooks (Lubrano quote → analysis)
4. **Cost of mobility**: Relationships as price of admission (compress WorldVentures to 2 sentences)
5. **Vocabulary gap**: Structural disadvantage of not knowing the questions (compress Lexus to 2 sentences)
6. **Family transmission**: Habits pass without explanation (ties example, code-switching)
7. **Legitimacy surveillance**: Slurs police belonging; straddlers always on trial (compress ¶9)
8. **Conclusion**: Visibility as first step; less shame, more care (expand)

---

## Next step: Revise in order

Work paragraph by paragraph using the revised versions above. For each:
1. Lead with Lubrano's claim (quote or paraphrase + page number)
2. Unpack the mechanism (HOW it works: hinge, code-switch, gatekeeping, vocabulary gap, surveillance)
3. Add brief personal illustration (2-3 sentences max) if it clarifies the mechanism
4. Analyze the consequence (WHY it matters: cost, displacement, illegibility, shame)
5. Tie back to thesis

This keeps you in the B+ to A- range by maintaining 70-80% analysis while using your experience strategically.
