- **Body Paragraph 2**: How both authors develop the theme through character
- **Body Paragraph 3**: How both authors resolve or leave the theme unresolved

#### Option B: Text-by-Text Comparison

- **Body Paragraph 3**: What these differences reveal about the theme

## Comparative Theme Options

### Option 1: Violence and Trauma
**Compare how each author portrays**:
- Different types of violence (state violence vs. political violence)
- How trauma affects individuals and communities
- The role of witness and testimony
- Healing and resistance in the face of trauma

**Potential Thesis Example**: "While both Thomas and Danticat explore the devastating impact of state violence on Black communities, Thomas focuses on individual empowerment through voice while Danticat emphasizes collective memory and witness, revealing how resistance takes different forms depending on the specific nature of oppression."

### Option 2: Family and Community Support
**Compare how each author presents**:
- Family relationships under pressure
- Community responses to crisis

### Option 3: Finding Voice vs. Bearing Witness
**Compare how each author explores**:
- Different forms of testimony and speaking truth
- Who has the responsibility to tell stories
- The cost of speaking vs. the cost of silence
- How stories preserve memory and demand action

**Potential Thesis Example**: "While Starr's journey toward public voice in 'The Hate U Give' and the anonymous narrators' private letters in 'Children of the Sea' seem opposite, both authors argue that storytelling—whether public or private—serves as an act of resistance that preserves dignity in the face of dehumanizing violence."

### Option 4: Displacement and Belonging
**Compare how each author addresses**:

- Code-switching and multiple identities
- The search for safe spaces
- What it means to belong in hostile environments
