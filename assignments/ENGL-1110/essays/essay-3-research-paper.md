## Source Integration Strategies

### Effective Research Integration
1. **Your voice first**: Lead with your analysis, support with research
2. **Conversation, not decoration**: Use sources to engage with ideas, not just prove points
3. **Synthesis**: Combine multiple sources to support complex arguments
4. **Attribution**: Always make clear who said what

### Sample Integration Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Research Supporting Your Analysis
"Thomas's portrayal of Starr's linguistic code-switching reveals the psychological complexity often overlooked in sociolinguistic research. While Johnson argues that code-switching represents 'adaptive flexibility' in multicultural environments (45), Starr's experience suggests a more troubling reality..."

#### Pattern 2: Research Providing Context
"The prevalence of code-switching among African American students has been well-documented (Smith 23; Brown 56), but the emotional toll of constant linguistic performance receives less attention. Thomas addresses this gap by showing..."

#### Pattern 3: Engaging with Scholarly Debate
"Critics disagree about whether code-switching empowers or constrains speakers. Martinez argues for empowerment (78), while Johnson emphasizes constraint (145). Thomas's nuanced portrayal suggests both perspectives capture partial truths..."
