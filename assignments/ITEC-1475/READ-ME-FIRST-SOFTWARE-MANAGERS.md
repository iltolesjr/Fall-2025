## ⚠️ Critical: Question 15

Question 15 in the lab asks:

> "Reflect on the instruction at the beginning of this lab to 'Read through the lab below in full, every word, then go back to the top and take action.' Why do you think this instruction was given? Provide at least three specific examples from this lab where reading ahead before taking action would have been beneficial."

**This question tests whether you actually read first!**

If you:
- **Did read first**: You'll have specific examples from your experience
