- Server documentation file not created

---

## Detailed Output Analysis

### ✅ Step 1-2: System Information & Network (COMPLETED)

```
Static hostname: fj3453rb-mint
Operating System: Linux Mint 22.1
Kernel: Linux 6.8.0-51-generic
Architecture: x86-64
```

**Status**: ✅ **Working Correctly**

**Your system details:**
- Hostname: `fj3453rb-mint`
- IP Address: `10.14.75.235/24`
- Network Interface: `ens33`
- Internet Connectivity: ✅ Verified (ping to google.com successful)

**What's Good:**
- System is properly connected to the network
- Basic system information is retrievable
- System is up-to-date and running

**Note**: You should still complete the hostname configuration step from the lab instructions to set a proper server name with your StarID:
```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname lennox-server-[YourStarID]
```

---

### ❌ Step 3: Administrative User Account (NOT COMPLETED)

```
\n=== id serveradmin (if exists) ===
serveradmin user not found
```

**Status**: ❌ **User Not Created**

**What This Means:**
The `serveradmin` user account has not been created yet. This is a required step in the lab.

**To Complete This Step:**
```bash
# Create the administrative user
sudo adduser serveradmin

# Add to sudo group for admin privileges
sudo usermod -aG sudo serveradmin

# Verify the user was created correctly
id serveradmin
groups serveradmin
```

**📸 Screenshot Required**: Capture the output showing user creation and group membership.

---

### ❌ Step 4: SSH Configuration (NOT COMPLETED)

```
\n=== SSH config summary ===
grep: /etc/ssh/sshd_config: No such file or directory
```

**Status**: ❌ **SSH Server Not Installed**

**What This Means:**
The SSH server (`openssh-server`) is not installed on your system. This is required for remote server administration.

**To Complete This Step:**
```bash
# Install SSH server
sudo apt install openssh-server -y

# Backup the SSH configuration
sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup

# View important SSH settings
sudo grep -E "PermitRootLogin|PasswordAuthentication|Port" /etc/ssh/sshd_config

# Enable and start SSH service
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
```

**📸 Screenshot Required**: Capture the SSH configuration settings.

---

### ⚠️ Step 4: UFW Firewall (INCOMPLETE - CRITICAL ISSUE)

```
\n=== UFW status ===
ERROR: You need to be root to run this script
```

**Status**: ⚠️ **Script Not Run with Sudo**

**What This Means:**
The `collect_lennox_outputs.sh` script was NOT run with `sudo` privileges. Many commands require root access to display proper information.

**Critical Action Required:**
You must re-run the entire script with sudo:

```bash
# Navigate to the script location
cd /home/ira

# Run with sudo
sudo ./collect_lennox_outputs.sh
```

**Also Complete UFW Setup:**
```bash
# Install UFW if not installed
sudo apt install ufw -y

# Configure firewall rules
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable

# Verify firewall status
sudo ufw status verbose
```

**📸 Screenshot Required**: UFW status should show active firewall with rules.

---

### ❌ Step 5: Apache Web Server (NOT COMPLETED)

```
\n=== Apache status ===
Unit apache2.service could not be found.

\n=== curl localhost ===
curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 80 after 0 ms: Couldn't connect to server
```

**Status**: ❌ **Apache Not Installed**

**What This Means:**
The Apache web server has not been installed. This is a core requirement for the lab.

**To Complete This Step:**
```bash
# Install essential packages
sudo apt install -y curl wget htop net-tools tree nano vim

# Install Apache web server
sudo apt install -y apache2

# Enable Apache to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable apache2

# Start Apache service
sudo systemctl start apache2

# Check Apache status
sudo systemctl status apache2 --no-pager

# Test the web server locally
curl -I localhost
```

**Expected Result**: You should see HTTP response headers showing "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

**📸 Screenshot Required**: Apache service status showing "active (running)" and curl output.

### ✅ System Resources (INFORMATION CAPTURED)

```
\n=== df -h ===
/dev/sda2        31G   12G   18G  40% /

\n=== free -h ===
Mem:           2.9Gi       1.8Gi       382Mi
Swap:          3.3Gi       865Mi       2.5Gi
```

**Status**: ✅ **Information Captured**

**Your System Resources:**
- **Disk Space**: 18GB available (40% used) - ✅ Sufficient
- **RAM**: 2.9GB total, 1.1GB available - ✅ Adequate
- **Swap**: 2.5GB available - ✅ Good

**Analysis**: Your system has adequate resources for running a basic web server and completing the lab requirements.

---

### ❌ Step 7: Server Documentation (NOT COMPLETED)

```
\n=== /etc/server-info.txt ===
/etc/server-info.txt not found
```

**Status**: ❌ **Documentation File Not Created**

**What This Means:**
The server documentation file has not been created yet.

**To Complete This Step:**
```bash
# Create the server info file
sudo bash -c 'cat > /etc/server-info.txt <<EOF
Lennox Server Configuration
===========================
Server Name: $(hostname)
Administrator: [Your Name / StarID]
Setup Date: $(date +%F)
IP Address: $(hostname -I | awk "{print \$1}")
OS Version: $(lsb_release -ds 2>/dev/null || uname -mrs)
Services Installed: Apache2, UFW, SSH
EOF'

# Verify the file was created
sudo cat /etc/server-info.txt
```

**📸 Screenshot Required**: Display the contents of the server documentation file.

---

### ✅ Network Connectivity (VERIFIED)

```
\n=== ping (3 to google.com) ===
64 bytes from ord37s32-in-f14.1e100.net (142.250.190.14): icmp_seq=1 ttl=114 time=13.5 ms
--- google.com ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss
```

**Status**: ✅ **Internet Connection Working**

**What's Good:**
- Network connectivity is excellent
- 0% packet loss
- Response times are normal (13-14ms)

## Action Plan: Complete Your Lab

### Immediate Actions Required

#### 1. **Re-run Collection Script with Sudo** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
```bash
cd /home/ira
sudo ./collect_lennox_outputs.sh
```
This will give you complete information from all commands.

#### 2. **Complete Missing Lab Steps** (In Order)

**Step 3: Create serveradmin user**
```bash
sudo adduser serveradmin
sudo usermod -aG sudo serveradmin
id serveradmin
groups serveradmin
```

**Step 4a: Install and configure SSH**
```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server -y
sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup
sudo grep -E "PermitRootLogin|PasswordAuthentication|Port" /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

**Step 4b: Configure UFW firewall**
```bash
sudo apt install ufw -y
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status verbose
```

**Step 5: Install Apache**
```bash
sudo apt install -y apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl status apache2 --no-pager
curl -I localhost
```

**Step 7: Create server documentation**
```bash
sudo bash -c 'cat > /etc/server-info.txt <<EOF
Lennox Server Configuration
===========================
Server Name: $(hostname)
Administrator: [Your Name / StarID]
Setup Date: $(date +%F)
IP Address: $(hostname -I | awk "{print \$1}")
OS Version: $(lsb_release -ds 2>/dev/null || uname -mrs)
Services Installed: Apache2, UFW, SSH
EOF'
sudo cat /etc/server-info.txt
```

#### 3. **Run Collection Script Again** (FINAL VERIFICATION)
```bash
sudo ./collect_lennox_outputs.sh
```

This will create an updated `lennox-lab-outputs.txt` file showing all completed steps.

## Common Questions

### Q: Why did my script run but show errors?
**A**: You didn't run it with `sudo`. Many system commands require root privileges to display information. Always run: `sudo ./collect_lennox_outputs.sh`

### Q: Do I need to install SSH if I'm working locally?
**A**: Yes, SSH server installation is a required part of the lab, even if you're working on a local desktop/VM. It demonstrates understanding of server remote access configuration.

### Q: My Apache curl test failed. What should I do?
**A**: First ensure Apache is installed and running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status apache2
```
If it's not running, start it:
```bash
sudo systemctl start apache2
```

### Q: Should I use Linux Mint or Ubuntu Server?
**A**: Both work fine. Your Linux Mint 22.1 is compatible with all lab requirements since it's based on Ubuntu. Continue using what you have.
