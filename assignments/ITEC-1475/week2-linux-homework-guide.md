### Step 1: Preparation (5 minutes)
1. Read the main lab instructions completely
2. Open the completion document template
3. Connect to ITEC vCenter environment

### Step 2: Core Lab Tasks (45-60 minutes)
1. **Change Hostname**: `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname [YourStarID]-mint`
2. **Find IP Address**: `ip a` (look for 10.14.75.XXX)
3. **Update Hosts File**: `sudo nano /etc/hosts`
4. **Take Screenshots**: Document each major step

### Step 3: Group Collaboration (30 minutes)
1. **Share Information**: Post StarID and IP in group discussion
2. **Collect Group Data**: Gather classmate information
3. **Update Hosts File**: Add all group member entries

### Step 4: Testing & Submission (30 minutes)
1. **Test Connectivity**: `ping -c 2 [hostname]` for each member

## üìã Required Screenshots Checklist

Make sure you capture these 5 essential screenshots:

1. **üì∏ Hostname Change**: `hostnamectl` output showing new StarID-mint hostname
2. **üì∏ IP Discovery**: `ip a` output highlighting your system's IP address
3. **üì∏ Initial Hosts File**: `cat /etc/hosts` showing your hostname/IP entry
4. **üì∏ Group Hosts File**: `cat /etc/hosts` with all group member entries
5. **üì∏ Ping Tests**: `ping -c 2` results for each group member system

## üë• Group Collaboration Guide

### Information to Share
- Your StarID (e.g., ab1234cd)
- Your system's IP address (e.g., 10.14.75.123)

### Information to Collect
- Each group member's StarID and IP
- Format hostnames as: [StarID]-mint

### /etc/hosts Format
```
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       [YourStarID]-mint
[YourIP]        [YourStarID]-mint
[Member1IP]     [Member1StarID]-mint
[Member2IP]     [Member2StarID]-mint
[Member3IP]     [Member3StarID]-mint
10.14.75.205    gf4321yk-mint
```
