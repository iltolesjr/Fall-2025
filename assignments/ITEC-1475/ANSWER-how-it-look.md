# Answer to "how it look"

Hi! I reviewed your Lennox lab output from October 28, 2025. Here's your answer:

---

## Quick Answer

Your output looks **GOOD for where you are** but **NOT READY for submission** yet.

**Your system is working fine** - no problems there! But you haven't completed all the lab steps.

---

## What's Good ‚úÖ

1. **Your system works perfectly**
   - Network: Connected (IP: 10.14.75.235)
   - Internet: Working (0% packet loss)
   - Disk space: 18GB available - plenty!
   - Memory: 1.1GB available - good

2. **Your output file was generated successfully**
   - The script ran
   - Data was collected
   - File was created

---

## What Needs Work ‚ùå

**Main Issue**: You didn't run the script with `sudo`!

Look at this line in your output:
```
ERROR: You need to be root to run this script
```

This means you ran:
```bash
./collect_lennox_outputs.sh          ‚Üê Wrong!
```

You should have run:
```bash
sudo ./collect_lennox_outputs.sh     ‚Üê Correct!
```

**Also Missing**: Lab steps not completed yet
- serveradmin user not created
- SSH server not installed
- Apache web server not installed
- Firewall not configured
- Server documentation file not created

---

## Your Progress

You're about **40% done** with the lab.

**Completed:**
- System is set up ‚úÖ
- Network is working ‚úÖ
- Script is downloaded ‚úÖ

**Not Completed:**
- Service installations ‚ùå
- User account creation ‚ùå
- Configuration steps ‚ùå

## What To Do Next

### Step 1: Complete the lab steps (1-2 hours)

**Create the user:**
```bash
sudo adduser serveradmin
sudo usermod -aG sudo serveradmin
```

**Install SSH:**
```bash
sudo apt install openssh-server -y
```

**Set up firewall:**
```bash
sudo apt install ufw -y
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw enable
```

**Install Apache:**
```bash
sudo apt install apache2 -y
sudo systemctl enable apache2
sudo systemctl start apache2
```

**Create documentation:**
```bash
sudo nano /etc/server-info.txt
# Add required information (see lab instructions)
```

### Step 2: Run script again WITH SUDO

```bash
sudo ./collect_lennox_outputs.sh
```

### Step 3: Check your new output

The new output should show:
- ‚úÖ All services installed
- ‚úÖ No "ERROR: need to be root" messages
- ‚úÖ Apache running
- ‚úÖ UFW active
- ‚úÖ serveradmin user exists
