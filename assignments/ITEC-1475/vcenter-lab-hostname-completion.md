## Lab Summary

### Commands Used Reference
| Command | Purpose | Result |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname [StarID]-mint` | Change system hostname | âœ… |
| `hostnamectl` | Verify hostname change | âœ… |
| `ip a` | Display IP configuration | âœ… |
| `sudo nano /etc/hosts` | Edit hosts file | âœ… |
| `cat /etc/hosts` | Display hosts file content | âœ… |
| `ping -c 2 [hostname]` | Test network connectivity | âœ… |

### Learning Objectives Achieved
- [x] Successfully changed system hostname using modern Linux tools
- [x] Configured network host resolution via /etc/hosts file
- [x] Tested network connectivity between group systems
- [x] Demonstrated understanding of IP address configuration

### Technical Notes
- **Hostname Change**: Used `hostnamectl` command (modern systemd approach)
- **Network Configuration**: Manual /etc/hosts entries for local name resolution
- **Connectivity Testing**: ICMP ping tests with packet count limitation
- **Group Collaboration**: Coordinated with group members for IP sharing

### Challenges Encountered
[Describe any issues you faced and how you resolved them]

### Academic Integrity Statement
- [ ] I completed this work individually except for appropriate group information sharing
- [ ] All screenshots are from my own system and terminal sessions
- [ ] I collaborated appropriately with group members only for IP address collection
- [ ] I understand the concepts demonstrated in this lab
