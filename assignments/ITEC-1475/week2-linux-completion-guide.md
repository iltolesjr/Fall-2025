# Week 2 Linux Assignment Completion Guide - ITEC 1475

**Assignment**: vCenter Lab - Change Hostname  
**Course**: ITEC 1475-80  
**Instructor**: Brian Huilman  
**Status**: üî¥ Not Started ‚Üí üü° In Progress ‚Üí üü¢ Completed  

## Quick Start Checklist

### Pre-Lab Preparation
- [ ] Ensure you have access to a Linux system (Ubuntu/Mint)
- [ ] Have terminal access with sudo privileges
- [ ] Identify your StarID for hostname setup
- [ ] Create a folder for storing screenshots

### Lab Steps Progress Tracker

#### Step 1: Change Hostname ‚è±Ô∏è (~5 minutes)
- [ ] Run `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <YourStarID>-mint`
- [ ] Verify with `hostnamectl` command
- [ ] **üì∏ Screenshot**: Terminal showing new hostname
- [ ] Restart terminal to see hostname change in prompt

#### Step 2: Find IP Address ‚è±Ô∏è (~3 minutes)
- [ ] Run `ip a` command
- [ ] Identify your system's IP address (look for inet line)
- [ ] **üì∏ Screenshot**: IP address output
- [ ] Note down your IP address: ________________

#### Step 3: Update /etc/hosts File ‚è±Ô∏è (~10 minutes)
- [ ] Open hosts file: `sudo nano /etc/hosts`
- [ ] Update second line with your hostname
- [ ] Add new line with your IP and hostname
- [ ] Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter)
- [ ] Verify with `cat /etc/hosts`
- [ ] **üì∏ Screenshot**: Updated /etc/hosts file

#### Step 4: Group Collaboration ‚è±Ô∏è (~Throughout week)
- [ ] Post your StarID and IP in [Systems Group #4 Discussion](../../discussions/ITEC-1475/systems-group-4.md)
- [ ] Use the [Group Member Template](../../discussions/ITEC-1475/group-member-template.md) to track information
- [ ] Collect group members' information:
  - Member 1: StarID: _______ IP: _______
  - Member 2: StarID: _______ IP: _______
  - Member 3: StarID: _______ IP: _______
- [ ] Add group members to your /etc/hosts file
- [ ] **üì∏ Screenshot**: /etc/hosts with group entries

#### Step 5: Test Connectivity ‚è±Ô∏è (~5 minutes per member)
- [ ] Ping each group member: `ping -c 2 <hostname>`
- [ ] **üì∏ Screenshot**: Successful ping results for each member
- [ ] Keep your system running for others to ping you

### Submission Preparation ‚è±Ô∏è (~15 minutes)
- [ ] Organize all screenshots in chronological order
- [ ] Label each screenshot clearly
- [ ] Create submission document with all requirements
- [ ] Double-check all screenshots are readable
- [ ] Submit to appropriate assignment folder

## Common Commands Reference

| Task | Command | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Change hostname | `sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <name>` | Sets system hostname |
| Check hostname | `hostnamectl` | Displays current hostname info |
| Find IP address | `ip a` | Shows network configuration |
| Edit hosts file | `sudo nano /etc/hosts` | Open hosts file for editing |
| View hosts file | `cat /etc/hosts` | Display hosts file content |
| Test connectivity | `ping -c 2 <hostname>` | Send 2 ping packets |

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### Issue: Hostname not showing in terminal prompt
**Solution**: Close and reopen terminal window

### Issue: Permission denied when editing /etc/hosts
**Solution**: Make sure you're using `sudo nano /etc/hosts`

### Issue: Can't ping group members
**Solutions**:
- Verify their systems are powered on and connected
- Double-check /etc/hosts entries for typos
- Confirm IP addresses are correct

### Issue: IP address changes
**Solution**: DHCP may reassign IPs - coordinate with group if this happens

## Time Estimates
- **Individual work**: 30-45 minutes
- **Group coordination**: Throughout the week
- **Screenshot organization**: 15 minutes
- **Total time commitment**: 1-2 hours spread over the week

## Success Indicators
‚úÖ New hostname appears in `hostnamectl` output  
‚úÖ IP address identified and documented  
‚úÖ /etc/hosts file successfully updated  
‚úÖ All group members added to hosts file  
‚úÖ Successful ping responses from group members  
‚úÖ All required screenshots captured and labeled  
‚úÖ Documentation complete and submitted  

## Next Steps After Completion
- [ ] Update assignment tracker status to "Completed"
- [ ] Mark due date as met
- [ ] Save submission confirmation
- [ ] Help group members if they need assistance

**üí° Pro Tips**:
- Take screenshots immediately after each successful command
- Keep your terminal window large enough for clear screenshots
- Save group member information in a text file for easy reference
- Test ping connectivity multiple times if first attempts fail
