TL;DR (too long; didn't read) but this is what I want you to know. I am / was / have:

a first generation student
a combat veteran of the Gulf War
on academic suspension
lived in multiple foreign countries for six months at a time
divorced amicably after 26 years
parent of a trans child
a major astrophysics nerd
self-diagnosed autistic
adult diagnosed with ADHD
parent of a child with depression
still learning about IT
quite OCD
The LONG Version
I was born and raised in a small town in southwestern Wisconsin to a poor, working-class family. I started working when I was 11, delivering newspapers, and used that money to buy my first computer, a Commodore Vic-20, when I was in 7th grade. I joined the Army National Guard as a junior in high school to pay my way through college and was deployed overseas for the Gulf War, as a combat veteran, for six months for Operations Desert Shield and Storm in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. I served 15 years with my units ending as a Sergeant First Class (SFC E-7, promotable) and was the acting First Sergeant of our unit for the last year.

As an undergraduate in the late 80s and early 90s, I administered big Sun OS UNIX systems (one of which ran one of the first 500 web servers on the planet) and a Novell network with PCs and Macs connected to it. I’m proud to be a first generation college student who paid my entire way through school on my own (with financial aid, Pell grants, and GI Bill help)! I graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Computer Engineering from the University of Wisconsin - Madison with a focus on digital electronics, then worked for Electronic Data Systems (EDS) for a couple of years as a Windows NT systems administrator.

My partner got her first professor job which took us to Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I started working for LSU's central IT department as a Windows NT, IBM OS/2, and Novell server administrator, as well as managing labs of Macs, Windows 95, and IBM OS/2 PCs. I quickly moved on to managing bigger IBM AIX UNIX and PC Linux systems. I designed, built, administered, and maintained PC Linux systems and large UNIX systems, their storage, and networking for specific application needs. Along the way I was tapped to consult to the FBI about cyber security.

From there I moved to managing groups of UNIX/Linux systems administrators and soon became the Director of the High Performance Computing (HPC) group at LSU, designing and managing large supercomputing systems used by researchers across the campus, nation, and the world. In my tenure there we debuted what was at the time the fastest Linux supercomputer and the 19th fastest computer (overall) in the world. I also taught as an adjunct professor for the Computer Science department at LSU doing their Introduction to UNIX course. On my partner’s first sabbatical, we moved with our then two year old child to Auckland, New Zealand for six months in 2003. In our time in Baton Rouge I also earned my Masters in Business Administration (MBA) in Technology Management from the University of Phoenix, graduating in 2005.

We eventually moved back “home” to Saint Paul and I started my job at the University of Minnesota’s Supercomputing Institute (MSI) where I was the Director for Systems Administration and Technical Operations, overseeing a staff of 20 full-time employees who were responsible for managing the supercomputing systems, the network, all of the infrastructure server systems, and running multiple labs of workstations around campus. I also had a part-time role at the UofM doing mobile and academic computing special projects. Besides helping the UofM “Go Google” in 2011, my biggest project in that special role was starting the http://open.umn.edu/ project about Open Educational Resources (OERs), specifically focusing on open textbooks. Somewhere in there I was finally diagnosed with ADHD, which helped explain a lot about my life up to that point.

After my partner was awarded a Fulbright, the whole family lived in Vienna, Austria for six months in 2014. I then became a stay-at-home father, volunteering more of my time in the schools and the organizations my kids were part of. After several years of this I started looking for an encore career. Working with a career coach, I discovered I had a passion for teaching. Courses I taught in the military, at LSU, and all of the outreach talks I’ve done as a Director were highlights of my career. I was happy to join Minneapolis College as a full-time faculty member in late December 2017 and started teaching here in January of 2018. I been awarded tenure and am now an unlimited full-time faculty member here. I was elected by my fellow faculty to be the department chair of the ITEC program and have done that since summer of 2021.

My partner and I amicably divorced in 2019, after 26 years of marriage and 32 years of connection, and we still do family dinners and holidays together. My oldest daughter is 25, graduated college for video game design, and has worked for Bioware on Dragon Age: The Veilguard. My youngest son is 21, in his senior year at UofM-Duluth in an Environmental and Outdoor Education program. My hobbies include reading or watching science fiction; reading about cosmology, astronomy, physics, and everything space and aerospace related; and of course learning about all things technology related. I’m an accomplished endurance athlete, completing four Ironman triathlon events, two Boston Marathons, a 50 km race on the Superior Hiking Trail, and running the Grand Canyon Rim-to-Rim-to-Rim (74 km), among other marathons, half-marathons, triathlons, cycling, and swimming events.

Teaching here at Minneapolis College is a huge part of my life and I’m incredibly excited to be part of your Information Technology journey with you. There’s lots to explore and learn, so let’s get going!

Hi everyone, my name is Mahamud Yusuf. I’m from Kansas City, Missouri, and that’s where I grew up. I recently moved to Minnesota, and honestly, the move wasn’t the easiest at first, but it’s been teaching me how to adjust and get comfortable in a new place.

I graduated in 2024 from a private online high school. Doing classes online was a different kind of challenge—it forced me to stay on top of things on my own and really build better discipline with my time.

Family is a big part of my life. I’ve lived with my mom ever since I was a kid, and she’s been one of my biggest supports. She’s had a huge influence on me, and I’ve learned a lot about patience and resilience from her.

One of the things I enjoy the most is going to the gym. Working out is more than just staying in shape for me—it’s a way to clear my head, manage stress, and push myself to grow. It’s something I look forward to every day.

Tom Williamson posted Aug 30, 2025 12:22 PM
Hello, my name is Tom Williamson, I was born in Minneapolis MN and grew up in Roseville MN, I am 22 years old and am in the ITEC degree, going for a cybersecurity specialization. Previously I went to school in Texas for a year and a half at UT Austin going for a degree in Informatics (almost none of the classes transferred for as well so that is great), and I am planning on going to the U of M after finishing the associates degree here. My family is pretty much all from the Minnesota-Wisconsin area and despite not taking much of an interest in sports I do like to make fun of the Wisconsinites a bit whenever the Packers do bad. A lot of my family have history in the Minnesota college system; my mom and multiple grandparents went to the U of M and my dad worked as an IT guy there for a few years too. My parents are very techy people, my dad was a super early adapter of home computers, and my mom has worked in the tech industry her entire life, so I have had an interest in working with computers, and in particular cybersecurity, for a long time. I also enjoy hiking, cooking, history and stats.

Im Ira Toles son of Ira Toles, son of henry bess, son of elvin oscar bess.....before you they erase it i need to know! crawling through time in cooter missouri, conversating with my ancestors. grew born in east stlouis il,  grew up in queens. at ps 132 and ps 134 we all had assembly, and we pledged allegiance to the flag, of  the United States of America. Hulk Hogan was one my hero. This one boy said my new hat was corny. Ill never forget that. we learned Swahili. and we remember the 2nd day because it has the funny name .....kujichagulia. My paternal grandmother died right when i started doing genealogy. Whats helped me is not believing what anybody tells me plus my obsession with problem solving or stressing myself out. after investing the murder of my maternal grandmother willieva johnson i see a record of her son and city Counselman son murdered a cab drive for about $100 almost exact 90 days later Ray Williams shoots her 3x says the court papers with a shotgun and 12 men found him not guilty. My father used to beat me and make me read. I used to pray id be a good boy. im almost there. oh me and his half brother , his brother that never got along. his mom left him with her mom in Caruthersville moved to New York i guess after henry bess stayed with his wife im guessing. she took uncle Tomi with her? after finding black babies for sell in Natchez Mississippi, i like to say ive learned how to tiptop through records, proceed with caution. Natchez was the 2nd worst place. So i guess at one point the south could only have a certain amout of slaves so the huband and wife split them. I see the street "Beat" alot..beat 3, beat 4, with the head of house james johnson, wife jamie johnson, son james, james, james jr, james sr, jameie, jamiee, jamelou, jamieloub boby, oh and my favorite Little Berry Walker Carter. Pemiscot county, Caruthersville, cooter Missouri, they call it the bootheel. bloody Kansas happened in that area. I have so many relatives that fought for this country. I wonder what they would do if they were me? so after Willieva was murdered my mom and her siblings got separated. I found the twins after 40 yrs and day 2 they realized my mom is....Gloria. Gloria's been fighting with everyone everywhere. I told her im sure your mother would not appreciate how you treating her children and grandchildren and great grandbabies. Her father Walter was born in Natchez. As soon as i met him i tried to understand him. maybe if i triangulate that his experience growing up in Natchez Mississippi ,the things you were taught, time since 1870, what the 30's was like, animal instinct down to the neanderthal and i don't get it. I don't understand how a grown man at his time could be so trifling. sins of the father. and me and tina shares 1700 cm with me so she's been staying with the man thats not her father because our dna suggest your my moms bioglogical sister oh tony was murdered in 97 but i found my autie tina because her daughter yvonda did the ancestry for her. shes in the air force. Perfect timing...yall aint gonna shoot us are yall?......idk who told my uncle tomi that my second great grandmother might be an Ester Toles but i helped him look. found lucinda and  8yr old wilma lee carter in 1940 in caruthersvilles. because of slavery on the next block there's an Mr and Mrs Johny Johnson with their own james johnson, jamie johnson, james, james, james jr, james sr, jameie, jamiee, jamelou, jamieloub boby, oh and my favorite Little Berry Walker Carter....so i learned that the ED number will bring me back to those coordinates in time. 1950 caruthersville, pemiscout county missouri, first page i see is Ira Lee walker oh he's married oh thats a baby boy.. possibly grand uncle? next page lucinda carter,wilma toles 18, , 8 betty toles, abt 4 larry toles [uncle], the more i look for ester the more i try to prove myself right and wrong. what if something happened to her and thats why lucinda said in 1940 wilma carter is her daughter. I know we skeptical of people at our door asking us questions every damn 10yrs on the dot but why did lucinda say wilma toles is now her granddaughter but keep looking uncle says. delete my gedcom for the 70ish time started over, ira, ira, betty, wilma, ?ester, lucinda moore,ira, ira, betty, wilma, ?ester, lucinda moore,ira, ira, betty, wilma, ?ester, lucinda moore,ira, ira, betty, wilma, ?, lucinda moore,...find my maternal great grandmother that pops up in mittie james and louis sometimes lewis johnson's house in Camden Ouachita Arkansas in 1920 as a 16yr old girl named cordie Johnson. her tombstone says Claudia mae Johnson born Claudie mae Cobbs..theres only about 3 records she calls herself sometimes Cordie Cobbs..I think at birth her name got mixed up. Its always been Claudia daughter wilieva and others.......If my grandmother is born already and my grandfather is on the next page, which is technically like the next block then oooooohhhhhhh So i told my uncle i can talk to the dead the dead says the facts points to no ester toles and i know why. Did my grandma end up doing what her mother did. all these events lined up perfectly for me to be here? im a sin baby. what do you what or could want from me? Alls we had was our name aint that right Mrs Claudia Mae Cobbs? Oh and my favorite... Little Berry Walker Carter

Eric Stary posted Aug 29, 2025 8:12 PM
Hello everyone,

My name is Eric, and this will be my second semester here at MCTC. I am a Computer Support And Network Administration student. Although I am not a huge fan of talking about myself or sharing much as an introvert. I will try my best with this assignment.

I was born in the early 90's (yes, the 1900's) in Minneapolis and spent the first 3 years of my life in foster care. I was adopted by my loving parents at 4 years old. I have 3 siblings, 2 brothers and 1 sister. Before deciding to be a stay-at-home parent to me and my siblings. My mom worked as a nurse practitioner; my dad worked as a mechanical engineer for a large soft drink manufacturer.

I attended high school in the St. Paul suburbs and graduated in 2008. During school my biggest interests were music and video games. I played several instruments with friends, trying to record poor quality metal albums on a four-track recorder. After school was mostly spent setting up our consoles for LAN parties. We would play Halo until we were told to go home by the parents of whoever's house we ended up at that day.

Unfortunately, around the time of my graduation from high school. There had been a lot of instability in my home. I left the house to get away from everything and since then I've been working to support myself. I've found myself working in a number of different fields. Automotive, HVAC, facilities maintenance, and most recently as a security professional here in downtown Minneapolis. My current job has been one of the hardest and emotionally taxing jobs that I've had. But I also find it very rewarding at times when I'm able to help people.

I've always had an interest in technology and gaming. Now with a rapidly changing economy and so much focus on tech. I figured I would try to get a degree along with third party certifications and enter the IT industry. Being that I'm almost 16 years removed from high school and haven't written much since. Please forgive any poor grammar or formatting

Mubashir Shidane posted Aug 27, 2025 7:21 PM
Hello, my name is Mubashir Shidane. My ethnic background is Somalia although I was born here in Minnesota and taken good care of by my hard working parents. I am 19 years old my birthday was two days ago as I'm writing this. I've always been fascinated by computers my whole life. It all started with me as a kid staring in awe as my dad was finishing his work on his computer. I always tried to copy what he was doing but I was never allowed to. My current major is Cybersecurity. I have heard great things about it and how the pay was really good. It inspires me to work hard for my future and to also take care of my parents like they did with me. 

Some lore about me I like playing sports, play video games and into anime. I started anime in 2020 during covid and its the best piece of media I've consumed. I'm now slowly shifting towards manga which is also amazing. 

I'm in a family of 7 kids total including me. I am the third oldest with two elder sisters meaning I'm the oldest boy. I am blessed to have a nice and caring family as well.

In the future, I hope to be a professional at what I do and be financially comfortable in life. So I can take care of my future kids and family members. Every time I feel like giving up that's the main thing I think about that can push me forward.

Hello,

My name is Kevin. I was born and raised in Minnesota, also im currently majoring in cybersecurity here at MCTC. My family loves to travel a lot also likes to be outside, like playing sports or even going on walks. Hopefully, this winter, we can go to New York this year again to see my family over there. We mostly have our family living in New York, so we go every two years to see our family in New York or try to have them come to Minnesota. I like to be connected with nature and have things to do outside, even going on a walk would be great for me, also I like to play sports, it doesn't matter what type of sports, because I love to be active. I'm just hoping I have a great school year this year and hopefully get to learn new things every day in class.

Mohamed Salat posted Aug 26, 2025 3:29 AM
Hello everyone, my name is Mohamed Salat. I am currently studying Linux System Administration this semester here at Minneapolis Community College as part of my IT degree program.

When I first came to the United States, I did not know any English. In high school, I worked hard to learn the language, and my teachers were very supportive. They encouraged me and told me they could see my passion, which motivated me to keep going.

Over time, I realized that I wanted to pursue a career in the information technology industry. I enjoy working with computers and math, and I believe these skills will help me become successful in IT. My goal is to get a good job with strong income, not only to support myself but also to help people through technology.

Family is very important to me. I have five siblings—Kamal, Ikram, Dadir, Saida, and Amino—and I want to support them in their education and future goals, just as my family has supported me.

In the future, I hope to have a good job, a beautiful family, and a big house where we can all live together. I want to create a happy home for my family, full of laughter and support.

In short, my goals are education, family, and building a meaningful career in IT. I am excited to learn more in this course and to gain the skills I need for the future.

Hi, I'm Ilhan. I was born and raised in Burnsville, Minnesota. I have six people in my family, and I am the middle one, which definitely comes with its own challenges and advantages. I was born in 2004, and my birthday is on July 18th, I've always loved having a summer birthday because it usually means nice weather, more family and friends time, and a chance to really enjoy the day to the fullest.

I am Somali, and the most memorable event of my life was when I traveled to Somalia for the first time in 2020. Having the opportunity to see where my people are from, meet some relatives, and see the culture firsthand was something I will never forget and always hold dear to my heart.

I've been attending MCTC for about two years now, and I'm now studying in the field of cybersecurity. It's something that has really interested me because of the importance it holds in our world today, and I've really enjoyed what I'm learning more and more every semester. My aspiration is simply to continue building on my knowledge and skills so that one day I can truly make a difference in the industry.

what i love to do is going to the gym, lake, vacation, going out with my girls and etc.

Hi! My name is Anny. I was born in Mexico, and I moved to the U. S when I was 3 years old. I have never been back, but I hope that I am able to in the next couple of years. When we came here, we lived in Texas for a while and then California. My parents saw how bad employment was there and decided to move permanently to Minnesota. I have worked in different types of jobs. From McDonalds to CNA. I thought adding Cybersecurity to my resume would be a smart way to expand my career options.

 I have 2 kids, a 10th grader and a third grader, that are starting school next week. They are also in different activities that take up most of my time so being back in school is both a challenge but also a rewarding experience as I work toward building a better future for us.

This is my second year at MCTC. I am pursuing a degree in cybersecurity although I don’t know much about computers, I am getting very familiar with basics and programming. I hope to be able to land a job in the tech industry.

Hey everyone, My name is Mohamed Amin, but y'all can call me Amin. I'm 28 years old. I'm a Somali born in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and I have been lucky to see many parts and travel to Mogadishu, Kuala Lumpur, and Minneapolis. I love making new friends and learning about different cultures. I'm the second child in a big Somali family of 6 siblings and 2 parents. I would say I'm a nerd because I enjoy sci-fi and fantasy novels and movies. I also like playing video games, my favorite game is Rainbow Six Siege.

My name is Raeshawn and I'm currently studying Cyber Security and Network Administration. I was born and raised in Minneapolis, but all of my family (minus my dad) are in Wisconsin, where my mom was from. I got my business degree Spring 2024 but decided that wasn't for me. Most of my immediate family work in IT, so they inspired me to look into it and here I am. I currently work in a pet store doing everything from stocking shelves to working with the animals. My favorites are the cats and guinea pigs. The biggest thing I like to do is watch sports; I watch all of them except for soccer (can't get into that one for some reason). My favorite teams are the Twins, Brewers, Timberwolves, Wild, and Vikings. I'm very excited for football and basketball season to start. Another thing I love to do is spend time with my family. I come from a big Native American family; my mom was one of ten kids, so family gatherings and cookouts are always fun.

Hello Everyone,

I'm Stephano Mante, but you can call me Stephano. I'm an International Student from Ghana, West Africa. I have been in the Twin Cities for some time now (only 3 years). I have loved my stay here and the beautiful places and people I have engaged so far except the winter (a bit unsettling and frustrating at times). I am in my third semester in MCTC with Cybersecurity and Defense Policy as my major. It hasn't been easy yet worth the challenge and progress so far. I free myself up watching and listening to podcasts, music videos, playing games (periodic), reading (bible precisely and some selected books) and playing soccer. Thus, just it! lol. I am looking forward to connecting with y'all and excited for the class ahead.

Benjamin Kownack posted Aug 29, 2025 11:35 AM
Hello, my name is Benjamin Kownack,

  and it's a pleasure to be back at Minneapolis Community College. After first attending this school some 39 years ago, I'm returning to higher education at the age of 60 to pursue a major in Artificial Intelligence (AI). I believe that foundational classes, like this Linux course, are essential to building a strong base for my future studies in AI and Python.

My interest in technology started early and led to a wonderful 20-year career in the IT field. I spent many of those years as a Technical Support Specialist for two major companies, America West Airlines / US Airways and UPS , in their information systems departments. My work involved providing first and second-level technical support and troubleshooting for thousands of end-users. I'm proud to say I have amazing experience with Linux and its applications, some of which I helped install and are still running today on old PCs with only two reboots in 15 years.

Outside of my career, I've had a passion for travel, which was fostered during my time with the airlines. My travels have taken me to places like the coastal jungle of Manuel Antonio, Costa Rica. I also eventually moved to Sacramento and San Francisco, California, where I loved the city’s diversity and vibrant food scene.

Lastly, I'm excited to share that I'm starting an AI Collective Club right here in Minneapolis College. I hope to inspire others and find new ways to use AI in various fields, from cybersecurity to nursing. 

Thanks   Best advise:  Create your free Linkedin account and profile!

TLDR (Dog photos below)

My name is Berit, I’m 31 years old and this is my second time being a freshman in college. I’m majoring in Software Development and  I use to go to Minneapolis College of Art and Design from 2013 -2019, with a major in illustration. For one reason or another, I decided to take a break from MCAD and just never went back. 

My family consists of a mom, dad, a bother (who is getting married next year!), and two dogs. I’ll pay the pet tax with these photos. 

Memphis, Black Lab, Female, 8 years old

Moses, Sheepadoodle (Sheep Dog + Poodle), Male, 3 years old 

Hope you enjoyed that!

Otherwise for jobs, for the last three years during my stay at MCAD I worked at a local movie theater before the pandemic started. I started job hunting again in 2022 and after a while I started working a toy store named Legacy Toy’s for over a year. Then this past summer I worked for Minneapolis College as a mentor for their Summer Spark program. It’s an event where high school kids from around the metropolitan area come visit Minneapolis College for three days and learn about what college is like while playing fun games and wining prizes! It was a lot a fun. Now, sometime this fall, I’ll be working at the IT help desk at Minneapolis College. Maybe you’ll see me there.

Sahra Elmi posted Aug 26, 2025 8:30 PM
Hi everyone, my name is Sahra. I was born and raised in Minnesota, but my family is originally from Somalia. My mom came to the U.S. in the 1990s, and I grew up here as a first-generation Somali American. I have a close family, and a lot of my motivation comes from wanting to do well for them and to build a future that makes them proud.

For school, I’ve been working on my degree here at Minneapolis College. I’ve taken classes in programming, writing, and IT systems, and I like how they challenge me in different ways. I’m also interested in gaming and reading books. On top of that, I have some personal life experiences, like dealing with a spinal cord injury, which taught me how to stay strong, keep pushing myself, and not let obstacles stop me. 

I currently can't work right now due to my disability, but right now I’m focused more on school and physical therapy. My long-term goal is to get into tech or creative design, and maybe combine both.

In my free time, I enjoy writing, watching reality TV shows like Big Brother, and spending time with friends and family. I’d say I’m a mix of tech-minded and creative, which keeps life interesting.

Hello, my name is CJ Bettis, I was born and raised in Minneapolis Minnesota and I am 23 years old. I am muslim, I have 5 siblings total, including one that has passed. I am currently a Financial Counselor lead at a hospital that is considered a non-profit. I have a passion for Youtube and real estate, as I one wish to have a portfolio that will be able to be considered generational wealth.

In my spare time I may vlog, game (pc or p5; for all my gamers), go to the gym and last acquire knowledge. I am currently taking the Cybersecurity  pathway, as I aspire to become a Cybersecurity professional with the interest of also being able to consider myself a programmer. I am working toward currently obtaining the Comptia security + certification, then moving toward searching for an entry level job (possibly IT Help desk; to narrow down and understand the fundamentals with actual hands on experience) that will support me obtaining my government security clearance. 

I want to turn my career into a lifestyle; I love being able to travel and explore the world - me obtaining my security clearance allows me to have the likely possibility to be paid to travel and explore different cultures; while also being the first line of defense for sensitive data. I have traveled out the country to Bali, Dominican Republic, Mexico (Cancun) and lastly Aruba. I want to be able to showcase for my community as well as for my family there is an ethical way to get the things that you desire out of life. The top 5 countries I'd like to travel to include; Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Greece, Italy and lastly Brazil.

Hello everyone! 

My names Rob! I was born and raised in Minneapolis and I've lived here for my entire 28 years of life. I was raised in a poorer working class family. My father was an HVAC and my mother was a stay at home mom until I was 7 years old, she now does office work. Out of their 4 kids, I'm the youngest and since I'm the youngest I spent a significant portion of my childhood by myself and tech of all kinds sort of became the main way I kept myself busy.  I graduated from high school in 2015 and soon after started my first semester of college for graphic design at the Art Institutes International Minneapolis campus.  Unfortunately for me, The school closed during my first semester and I was left saddled with the debt from student loans and no degree or transferable credits to speak of. After the closure of the school I entered a prolonged state of depression while I worked a multitude of jobs to pay off my debt. I worked for around 9 years before I got an email from the government informing me that the federal student loans I had taken out were forgiven under borrowers defense, they certainly took their time getting that all sorted out. However once I got the email I quit my last job and applied for FAFSA and enrolled here at Minneapolis college. 

I'm now in my fourth semester, and I'm dual majoring in Cyber Security and Network Administration. A lot has happened in the short time I've been here at the college. I made lots of friends, rebooted the Computer Club and served as it's president last spring and now I'm the current president of the Cyber Defense Club! (join our discord lol)  Also, just today I started my student worker position at ITS!  It's a lot of work, but I enjoy doing it. I look forward to joining you all in this class and I hope we all learn lots of cool new things!

Hello, my name is Suhayb I was born in Ethiopia, raised in boffola New York and Minneapolis MN. I am a first gen college student I am currently pursuing a four year degree in cybersecurity, depending on how things go I would also like to pursue an associate degree in IT. Outside of cybersecurity and IT I have been drawn to Business, when I was kid I always wanted to open my own business but found an extreme interest for cybersecurity although it's been difficult I still enjoy learning about new ways of strengthening my knowledge and learning. Before college I was thinking about joining the army for financial assistance and a job as a cyber defense analyst.

Hello everyone,

My name is Julian Abril and am excited to start class with you all. I was born and as I like to say half way raised in Bogota, Colombia. I enjoy experiencing different cultures, anime, traveling, gaming, soccer, basketball, and enjoy listening to music. My favorite place I have been to is Kauai or Puerto Rico. Dragon ball is my al time favorite anime since it is what i grew up watching back home. Barcelona is the best team and Messi is the GOAT. I listen to everything besides country and might be going to Linkin Park tomorrow after class! 

My family and I got the opportunity to move to the United States back in 2007 thanks to my moms job. She used to be an English teacher back home and they offered her a teaching job in Iowa to teach Spanish. Yes, Iowa is everything you guys think off. A lot of corn, few things to do, very boring. Luckily, a school here in Minnesota decided to sponsor our Visa and later on residency so we could get the opportunity to live here in the USA. I am guessing we liked it so much because we have been here since.

I went to Minnetonka High school and graduated 2017. After High School I wasted a couple of semesters at Normandale because I didn't know what to. do and though I had to do school right away. After i stopped i decided to start working as a chef in the kitchen and work on getting my citizenship here in the USA. During that time I traveled, worked, and was just going through life as it came. 

I finally got my citizenship on November 2023. After a long long looooong process, i finally achieved a big goal in my life and something most people don't get to experience. After I thought, what next? I gave it some thought and thought it was a good idea to go back to school and expand my skills and get a bit more income and make something out of myself.

Being a first generation anything in my family, I want to be able to give back to my parents and grandparents and show them all their sacrifices didn't go to waste. Thinking about what I enjoy and is good for the future, I started thinking about technology and AI and how the world is going and I landed on cybersecurity so here I am! I started the cybersecurity and Network administrator degree Spring semester of 2024 and am working to always be better, work harder, experience new things, and grow as a person. Hopefully I can get a good job where I can always keep learning and growing, but most importantly able to give back to my parents and be comfortable here in this country.

Abdullahi Abdi posted Aug 25, 2025 3:14 PM
Hello everyone,

My name is Abdullahi Abdi. I was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, and due to the conflict and instability in my country, my family and I were forced to leave when I was nine years old. We relocated to Nairobi, Kenya, where I completed my elementary and high school education, providing a strong foundation for my future studies and personal growth. Life in Nairobi had its challenges, but it taught me the value of hard work, self-reliance, and supporting my family. My family has always encouraged me to strive for progress, and I have always thought about how I can help both them and my community.

When I arrived in the United States in 2023, I decided to continue my education and enrolled at Minneapolis College. Studying here has allowed me to pursue my academic goals while supporting my family.

I currently work as a paralegal, assisting people with immigration matters. This work has given me the opportunity to help many individuals navigate legal processes and has deepened my understanding of community service and the importance of supporting others.

I am also passionate about internet security and cybersecurity, and I aspire to become a cybersecurity expert to protect people from online threats and attacks. I enjoy learning new technologies and developing my skills in digital security.

Outside of work/College, I enjoy learning new skills, staying informed about global issues, and spending quality time with family and friends. I’m excited to be part of this class and to learn alongside all of you.
