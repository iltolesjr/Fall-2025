---
## 1. Global Formatting Preferences

- File naming: `YYYY-MM-DD_course_shortcode_type_topic.md` when date-specific; otherwise concise + descriptive.
- Title block at top including: Course, Assignment Name, Due Date, Your Name, Status (Draft / Final), and Word Count (for essays).
- Use level 1 `#` for document title, level 2 `##` for main sections, avoid skipping heading levels.
- Lists: Prefer numbered lists for processes, bullet lists for concepts.
- Tables: Use for trackers, comparison of themes, rubric alignment, vocabulary.
- Quotes: Short quotations under 40 words inline with double quotes; longer > 4 lines become block quotes (ENGL only) — keep minimal.
- Academic voice: Specific, concrete nouns; active verbs; avoid generic words (thing, stuff, very, really).
- Sentence combining target: Average sentence length ~22–28 words with varied openings; combine short adjacent sentences with conjunctions or subordinators.

## 2. ENGL-1110 (College Composition)

### Document Types & Structures

1. Reading Log Entry
   - Sections: Citation | Summary (objective) | Key Passages (3) | Analysis (2 paragraphs) | Vocabulary | Reflection | Questions.
2. Literary / Rhetorical Analysis Essay
   - Standard structure: Introduction with hook + context + arguable thesis; 3–5 body sections (analytical claims, evidence integration, explanation, significance); Counterpoint (if assigned); Conclusion (synthesis, broader implication, NOT repetition).
3. Discussion / Response Post
   - 150–300 words unless otherwise stated.
   - Structure: Opening claim or reaction | Evidence (quote/paraphrase) | Connection (course theme / prior text) | Open-ended question to peers.
4. Comparative Essay
   - Thesis includes clear axis of comparison (e.g., tone, narrative stance, depiction of class mobility).
   - Body paragraphs organized by analytical lens, not text-by-text ping-pong.

### Evidence Integration Rules

- Introduce quotes with context (speaker / situation) + analytic verb: argues, reveals, exposes, juxtaposes, laments.
- After quote: 2–3 sentences of commentary (function, meaning, connection to thesis).
- Avoid back-to-back quotes with no analysis.
- MLA in-text placeholder format until finalized: (Author page#) or (Short Title) if no page.

### Style Improvement Targets

| Issue Type | Replace Weak Pattern | Stronger Pattern Strategy |
|------------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Vague claims | "The author talks about..." | Specify lens: "Lubrano critiques the invisible social toll of upward mobility by..." |
| Short choppy sentences | 2–3 adjacent SVO sentences | Combine with subordination: "Because X, Y..." or coordination "..., yet ..." |
| Passive voice (unnecessary) | "It is shown" | Attribute to agent: "Lubrano shows..." |
| Generic verbs | says, talks about | analyzes, frames, contrasts, interrogates, positions |

### Revision Checklist (Essays)

- [ ] Thesis arguable & specific (contains claim + reasoning frame)
- [ ] Each body paragraph begins with a claim, not a summary
- [ ] Evidence ratio: ~30% quote/paraphrase, 70% analysis
- [ ] Logical transitions (however, meanwhile, consequently, in contrast)
- [ ] No paragraph ends with a quote
- [ ] Conclusion synthesizes stakes / implications
- [ ] Word count within assigned range (+/- 5%)

## 3. ITEC-1475 (Technology)

### Lab / Technical Document Structure

1. Purpose / Objective
2. Environment / Prerequisites
3. Step-by-Step Procedure (numbered, imperative verbs)
4. Validation / Verification (e.g., command output expected)
5. Troubleshooting (common errors + fixes)
6. Reflection / What You Learned
7. Submission Checklist

### Command & Documentation Style

- Use fenced code blocks for commands; one command per block.
- Provide expected sample output only when it clarifies success state.
- Bold warnings for irreversible actions: **Warning: This will remove existing configuration.**
- Avoid copying huge logs—summarize and isolate key lines.

### Tracking & Completion

For multi-stage labs: Provide a progress table.

| Stage | Task | Status | Evidence / Notes |
|-------|------|--------|------------------|
| 1 | Initial host configuration | TODO |  |
| 2 | Network setup | TODO |  |
| 3 | Service deployment | TODO |  |
| 4 | Verification tests | TODO |  |

### Troubleshooting Language

- Problem statement first, then probable cause, then resolution.
- Use format: Symptom | Diagnosis | Fix.

## 4. Cross-Course Productivity

### File Organization

- Store full reading analysis in `assignments/ENGL-1110/reading-assignments/`.
- Use `notes/` for lecture or class notes only (no polished analysis).
- Track deadlines in tracker files; link to assignment artifacts.

### Task Priority Framework

1. Hard deadlines (due in <48h)
2. Graded drafts / feedback incorporation
3. Reading responses before class discussion
4. Long-term projects (start early with milestone decomposition)

### Time Block Template (Weekday)

| Time | Focus |
|------|-------|
| 07:30–08:00 | Light review / reading skim |
| 08:00–09:00 | Writing (highest focus) |
| 13:00–14:00 | Lab / technical tasks |
| 16:00–16:30 | Revise / polish / submission prep |
| Evening | Short review + plan tomorrow |

## 5. Sentence Combining Examples (From Instructor Guidance)

| Before | After (Combined) | Technique |
|--------|------------------|-----------|
| Most of us write shorter sentences. Our sentences reflect our speech. | Most of us write shorter sentences, as our written rhythms mirror our speech. | Coordination (as) + nominal precision |
| The father works hard. He rarely complains. | The father works hard and rarely complains, framing endurance as quiet pride. | Coordination + appended interpretive phrase |
| The neighborhood felt small. I wanted to leave. | Because the neighborhood felt small, I wanted to leave. | Causal subordination |
| He leaves home. He enters a world of privilege. | Leaving home, he enters a world of privilege that unsettles his inherited loyalties. | Participial opener + contrast |

## 6. Specific Language Upgrade Bank

| Weak / Generic | Upgrade Options |
|----------------|-----------------|
| talks about | interrogates, critiques, situates, frames |
| shows | illustrates, illuminates, foregrounds, exposes |
| good/bad | beneficial / corrosive / generative / harmful |
| important | pivotal, foundational, consequential |
| different | divergent, contrasting, dissimilar |
| change | transition, shift, transformation |
| make people think | provoke reflection, destabilize assumptions |

## 7. AI Assistance Rules

- Ask for: outlines, thesis refinement, sentence combining, tone tightening, rubric alignment.
- Do NOT request: full essay drafts to submit unedited, large verbatim excerpts of copyrighted texts.
- Always revise AI output to reflect your authentic voice.
- Keep process-based artifacts (brainstorming, outline) separate from final drafts.

## 8. Quick Prompt Starters

| Purpose | Prompt Template |
|---------|-----------------|
| Thesis sharpening | "Refine this thesis to be more arguable: [draft]" |
| Paragraph audit | "Check this paragraph for evidence/commentary balance: [text]" |
| Lab clarity | "Is this step sequence logical?" + [steps] |
| Sentence combining | "Combine these 3 sentences while keeping meaning: [sentences]" |
| Specificity boost | "Suggest concrete nouns and verbs to replace: [list]" |

- [ ] Title block present & updated

- [ ] No placeholder text remains
- [ ] Spellcheck & formatting pass
