Hi class, I’ll keep this short. Danticat refuses to soften the violence so we feel what political terror does to bodies and memory, not just headlines. The black butterflies act like small warnings that bring bad news, and the repeated line about mountains and the sea shows that hardship keeps coming while love and memory remain constant. The boy on the boat sacrifices his past when he throws his notebook and likely drowns, which turns the story into witness. The lack of names and dates pushes readers into the present so we live the uncertainty with the characters. This hits me personally because I’ve felt surrounded and unprotected after recent political events, and seeing how power can destroy families makes me want to record these stories instead of letting them be erased. I’ll keep a longer journal and pull a short paragraph next time.
