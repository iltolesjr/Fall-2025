# Implementation Summary: Automated Project Board for Fall 2025 Assignments

## What Was Implemented

This document summarizes the changes made to automate your assignment tracking using GitHub Project Boards.

## 🎯 Goal Achieved

You wanted:
> "I wanna add assignments to the fall repo project board. Assignments that still need to be done for the whole year. And to separated by classes and then. The ones that are done. We put those in the completed section and then wherever we have started working on, we put that into working on in progress section of the board."

**Result**: ✅ Fully automated system that reads your tracker files and creates/updates a GitHub Project Board with proper organization!

- ✅ Parses assignment tables to extract name and status
- ✅ Maps status: "Not Started" → Todo, "In Progress" → In Progress, "Completed" → Done
- ✅ Adds course labels (ENGL-1110, ITEC-1475) to each issue
- ✅ Creates issues with proper metadata (course, status, tracker reference)
- ✅ Supports dry-run mode for safe testing
- ✅ Better error handling and verbose output

### 2. Bash Wrapper Script
