2. week 2 hostname: resubmit using the fast guide (30-45 min)
3. week 3 users + ssh: complete one-file lab (30-45 min)
4. quiz sprint block 1 (3 short quizzes, 20-30 min)

## tomorrow (nov 2)
1. week 4 ntp + dns: complete one-file lab (45-60 min)
2. week 7 ldap: run all-in-one script segment and submit (45-60 min)
3. quiz sprint block 2 (3 short quizzes, 20-30 min)

## monday (nov 3)

2. week 10 samba to windows: complete one-file lab (45-60 min)
