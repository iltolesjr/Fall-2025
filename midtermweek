8: 2025-10-13 Midterm Exam
Posted Oct 13, 2025 12:00 AM
This week you have your midterm exam! It will be in D2L and covers everything we've learned up to now, focusing on the command-line. It is open notes, open book, and open Internet (use any resources you can find). The exam will include true and false; multiple choice; and open, written response questions that will require you to prove your understanding of certain concepts.

Don't cheat (by talking or working with other students). Don't copy these questions onto College exam websites. You can take the exam any time you want in the week (it's available on Monday morning and is closed by Sunday night at midnight).

Do NOT wait until the last minute to take the exam! The exam is timed, you only have four hours, and if you have troubles with your Internet or D2L or run out of time, I will not make any exceptions.

Reminder: Tutoring Available
Posted Oct 2, 2025 12:00 AM
As a reminder, FREE tutoring is available to you for a range of ITEC classes from some of your own classmates who work for the Academic Success Center (ASC). Please see the ITEC Tutoring Schedule document for the schedule and follow this link for instructions on how to create your tutoring session.

The ASC also helps you setup study groups, can provide basic computer support, and has computers available for you to use if you're on-campus.

Finally, all Minneapolis College students receive 15 hours per academic year of FREE time on Tutor.com, which supports general computer science, database, programming languages (Python, Java, HTML/CSS/PHP, C#), and more! This service can be accessed at any time under the Resources menu (above) and selecting Tutor.com.

Reminder: Missing / Late Work
Posted Oct 1, 2025 12:00 AM
As a reminder, in spite of what my syllabus says, you can do any missing work and submit it for a full grade. Even if it's already been graded with a zero (0), you can still do the work. If you turn it in, I WILL GRADE IT, FULLY. Please work on anything you may have missed up to this point and get it submitted. Whatever you turn in, I will grade. This offer ends by the midterm in a couple of weeks, and any items not turned in will receive a 0, so get things done NOW.

You can always check your grades to see what you might be missing or how you're doing so far in the class.

Student Clubs in ITEC
Posted Aug 26, 2025 12:00 AM
Student clubs are a great way to share your time with like-minded students, to exercise your leadership, and to have something more to put on your resume. Consider joining one or more of these clubs today! You can get more information about all the clubs on campus at the Connections Fair.
