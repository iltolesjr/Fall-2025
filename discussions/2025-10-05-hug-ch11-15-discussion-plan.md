**Due Date (Original Post)**: Sunday Oct 5, 2025 (per schedule listing: "Week 3 Discussion: HUG Ch. 11–15")  
**Suggested Original Post Length**: 250–320 words  
**Peer Replies**: 2 meaningful responses (≈100–150 words each) within 24–48 hours after posting (or earlier if rubric specifies)

## 1. Purpose Clarification
These chapters shift Starr from a reactive witness to an intentional narrator of injustice. Your discussion post should:  
- Advance a focused claim (NOT plot summary)  
- Use 2–3 concise textual moments (short quoted phrases or partial sentences)  
- Show how form (voice / code-switching / dialogue / pacing) shapes meaning  
- Connect to a broader theme (voice, systemic power, communal responsibility)  
- End with an authentic, open-ended question inviting peers to extend—not just agree

## 2. Quick Reading Triage (If You’re Behind)
| Situation | Tonight’s Priority | Time Block |
|-----------|-------------------|------------|
| Haven’t started Ch. 11–15 | Read 11–13 deeply; skim 14–15 for structure | 70–80 min |
| Read once, light notes | Re-read scenes you might quote; annotate margins for voice shifts | 40–50 min |
| Fully annotated | Move straight to drafting analytical claim & selecting quotes | 25–30 min |

---
## 3. High-Leverage Scenes (Pick 1–2)
| Chapter | Moment | Why It’s Analytical Gold |
|---------|--------|--------------------------|
| 11 | Evolving media attention / Starr processing narrative control | Shows pressure of external framing vs. personal truth |
| 12 | Family dialogue about safety vs. speaking out | Tension between protection and activism |
| 13 | Code-switch moment contrasted with Starr’s internal monologue | Exposes linguistic self-regulation as survival strategy |
| 14 | Escalation of community unrest / collective emotion | Connects personal grief to systemic anger |
| 15 | Starr articulating purpose of telling Khalil’s story | Transition from witness to agent |

---
## 4. Draftable Claim Templates (Choose & Personalize)
1. Identity/Voice Shift:  
   Starr’s shifting diction between home, school, and public spaces in Chapters 11–15 reveals that code-switching isn’t performance—it’s strategic harm reduction that becomes activism once she consciously refuses to mute specific emotional registers.
2. Narrative Control:  
   The tension in Chapters 11–15 between media simplification and Starr’s layered interior narration shows the novel arguing that truth isn’t just what happened—it’s who gets to repeat it without distortion.
3. From Witness to Agent:  
   By Chapter 15, the novel reframes witness testimony from passive recollection to deliberate social intervention, as Starr recognizes that telling Khalil’s story is a counter-force against institutional narrative erasure.
4. Emotional Duality:  
   The juxtaposition of Starr’s public composure and private cognitive overload in these chapters dramatizes trauma’s invisible labor and critiques audiences that demand clarity from those still processing harm.

> After picking one, sharpen with a because-clause naming a craft feature (e.g., “because Thomas uses fragmented internal syntax against polished external speech”).

## 5. Evidence Selection Grid
| Potential Quoted Fragment (Short) | Function | How You’ll Analyze (Mechanism → Meaning) |
|----------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| "(Insert phrase)" | Code-switch moment | Contrast register; link to survival & agency |
| "(Insert phrase)" | Media framing | Show distortion vs. Starr’s correction |
| "(Insert phrase)" | Internal monologue | Syntax mirrors cognitive overload |

Keep each quotation under 12 words if possible. Embed grammatically: Thomas shows Starr “(quote)” before she …

## 6. Model Skeleton (≈275 Words)
1. Hook (1–2 sentences): Immediate tension or paradox (“Starr learns the cost of sounding acceptable while grieving the unacceptable.”)  
2. Claim Sentence: Use one template, refined with a because-clause.  
3. Context + Evidence 1: Micro-scene setup (no summary dump) + quoted fragment + 2–3 sentences of close reading (diction, syntax, contrast).  
4. Evidence 2: Build—not repeat. Show escalation or shift.  
5. Synthesis: How these craft moves reposition Starr’s role & prep the novel’s larger argument about narrative ownership.  
6. Question: Invite peers to consider alternative lens (“Where do you see Starr choosing silence as power rather than fear in these chapters?”)

## 7. Analysis Moves Cheat Sheet
| Move | How to Phrase |
|------|---------------|
| Diction Precision | The verb “___” compresses Starr’s… |
| Syntax / Structure | The abrupt sentence break after… simulates… |
| Contrast | Externally she says “__,” yet internally… |
| Reframing | What looks like hesitation functions as… |
| Thematic Bridge | This moment refracts the novel’s broader claim that… |

## 8. Possible Peer Reply Strategies
- Extend: Add a different scene that intensifies their claim.  
- Reframe: Suggest an alternative function for the same quote.  
- Connect: Link their observation to a future chapter (without spoiling specifics).  
- Question: Ask how a craft element (pacing, silence, gesture) changes interpretation.

Template Reply Starter:
> You note Starr’s shifting voice; adding Chapter __’s moment when she ___ shows that the shift isn’t linear but adaptive, suggesting the novel frames linguistic flexibility as tactical resilience.

## 10. Quick Quality Checklist Before Posting
- Claim = arguable, not descriptive  
- Each quote < 12 words & integrated grammatically  
- After each quote: HOW first, THEN WHY it matters  
- No paragraph ends in a quotation  
- Final question cannot be yes/no and invites textual engagement  
- Avoid filler transitions (“In conclusion”)—use synthesis instead

---
## 11. Optional Style Upgrades (Pick 1)
| Upgrade | Application |
|---------|------------|
| Precise Verbs | Replace “shows” / “says” with “frames,” “concedes,” “compresses” |
| Echo Control | Deliberately repeat 1 key term twice for emphasis (e.g., “voice”) |
| Rhythm Shift | One short sentence after a long analytical sentence for punch |

---
## 12. Draft Question Ideas
- Where does Starr deliberately keep part of the truth offstage—and is that withholding protective or strategic?  
- How do chapters 11–15 redefine what counts as “bravery” in the novel?  
- Which moment most clearly marks the pivot from surviving to narrating, and why?

## 13. Submission Reminder
If the LMS still labels it “Week 3 Discussion,” ignore the numbering mismatch and aim for analytical excellence over recap. Anchor every interpretive move to a textual feature (word, gesture, silence, pacing).
