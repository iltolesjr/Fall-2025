Saabrin Hirad posted Aug 27, 2025 7:35 PM
Hi, my name is Saabrin and I'm a junior in high school . I'm taking this class because I want to learn more about how books talk about real-world problems. I enjoy drawing and spending time with friends and family.

The phrase "Keep your hands up, don't make any sudden movements, only answer when addressed" was something Starr's father taught her when she was a child. Thomas includes it to indicate how Black children must be taught rules to avoid harm from the police — rules that other children don't typically have to worry about.

When Starr's dad talks to her about Tupac, Black Panthers, and Nat Turner, he is trying to teach her about racism and why it still exists. Thomas is trying to get us to know that Black people's problems today have a deep history.

At chapter's close, Starr overhears her parents fight over moving out of their neighborhood. She informs Officer 115 (the officer who has killed Khalil) that he is splitting up her family, as well. This suggests racism and police brutality don't just physically harm individuals they hurt families and communities, as well.

Keyse Haji posted Aug 29, 2025 6:08 PM
Hi, my name is Keyse Haji. I am currently a senior in high school, and I plan to major in cardiology in the future. This is my second semester at MCTC, and I’m really excited to keep learning here. My current favorite show is Swat on Netflix, and one of my favorite books is Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. I also enjoy playing FIFA, and I’m part of my school’s soccer team. I recently made varsity, which I’m very proud of. When it comes to food, I like so many things that it’s hard to choose a favorite, but pizza is definitely near the top.

Who says the lines “Keep your hands visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to”?
Momma says, “Keep your hands visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to.”


When did Starr first hear them?
She hears them from her momma as they get stopped at a police roadblock. Starr gets really nervous, saying it “grabbed my heart and twisted it,” because she remembers what happened to Khalil when he was pulled over by the police.


Why does Thomas include these lines? What is she trying to say to readers?
I think Thomas is trying to communicate that Black people and other minorities are forced to live by rules like this to survive encounters with police. It shows how dangerous and scary something as simple as a traffic stop can be. This is Thomas showing readers the reality that families actually have to teach their kids these survival rules so they don’t get killed.

Why does Thomas include Tupac’s lyrics, the Black Panthers, the Nat Turner rebellion, and Maverick’s gang story here in the middle of the chapter?
It shows that Black people have always tried different ways to fight back against oppression and find justice. From music like Tupac’s rap, to rebellions to community groups like the Panthers, people have looked for ways to resist racism and unfair treatment. Maverick even shares his own story of being in a gang to explain how some young people look for belonging and power when they feel powerless in society. Thomas puts this in the middle of the chapter to connect the past and the present and to show that these struggles are not new; they've been happening for generations. Daddy says, “Exactly. We can’t be silent,” which means people must keep speaking up and pushing back.


What is the effect on the reader, and how does it connect to the bigger themes of injustice?
The effect on the reader is that it makes us realize injustice is still around and hasn’t gone away, even if it looks different now. It connects to the bigger theme by showing that racism has deep roots in history, and people are still finding ways to survive, cope, and resist it today. It also makes readers think about how they should not be silent when facing unfairness.

Who is “One-Fifteen” (115)?
One-Fifteen is the police officer who shot and killed Khalil.


When Starr says, “That’s one more thing One-Fifteen takes from me,” what does she mean?
She means her family. The shooting already took her friend Khalil’s life, and now the stress of it is starting to tear her parents apart.


How does Thomas show that police violence doesn’t just kill, it also divides families and communities?
She shows this because Starr’s parents are starting to fight more than before. They used to talk about moving but never got serious about it, but after Khalil’s death, they argued deeply about whether to leave the neighborhood or stay. This shows how violence in the community puts families on edge and can break them apart. It also shows that police brutality doesn’t just affect one person; it spreads pain through whole families and neighborhoods.

Hey guys my name is Taryn, I'm a part-time PSEO student who currently goes to South Highschool 

In chapter 10 of The Hate You Give Angie Thomas has the intention of telling her readers how impactful and traumatic Starr witnessing the death of her friend Khalil but also highlighting the fact that systemically black and brown bodies specifically get targeted especially in lower income neighborhoods. Angie Thomas made a good point on page 165 on the top when Starr was talking about gripping the door handle tighter in fear for her life which is especially important considering the history of the police with black men and women. Page 168, THUG life was brought up which I think is important because people always use the term thug without knowing what it means but THUG life meaning The Hate U give Little infants fucks everybody was intentionally put in the book to inform readers of the history of a frequently used word. The way Devonte is brought up in significant because that's the way Maverick was brought up and his dad and Khalil proving that there's a cycle especially growing up with not a lot of money and resources conveniently set up by the government which also intertwines with private prisons and profit off of black and brown bodies. ill continue if i can my computer is gonna die

Khana Froiland posted Aug 29, 2025 8:44 PM
Hello! My name is Khana (she/her) and I'm in my first semester at MCTC, pursuing an Associate's Degree in HSER (Pre-Social Work). Academically, my goal is to complete a Master's of Social Work to then work as a therapist. For the past sixteen years I've worked difference service jobs, mostly in restaurants. In my free time I love to play and watch basketball, forage, cook, and watch movies.

The second page has 3 lines in italics: "Keep your hands visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to"(165). Who speaks the lines? When did Starr first hear them," and why does Thomas share them - to say what to readers? The person who speaks these lines is not explicitly named, but we can imply that Starr has heard them before - likely from an elder who has survived police interaction. Thomas shares these lines to show readers that Starr has been taught the danger of police in her community from a young age.

(Maverick) takes her with him to restock his store and shares lyrics from Tupac's "Keep ya Head up," information on the Black Panthers and the Nat Turner rebellion of 1831, and more of his own story being gang-affiliated and locked up. Why? What is Thomas doing by sharing this information in the middle of the chapter?

 Thomas shares personal, political, cultural, and historical examples of Black Resistance to White Supremacy in a conversation between a father, Maverick, and his daughter, Starr. Thomas places these lessons in the middle of Chapter 10 to illustrate the crossroads at which this family sits: in the wake of police murder of their loved one, will they flee Garden Heights or stay and fight for their neighborhood? What is the right thing to do, and is there any path towards safety or freedom for Black people in America?

Early in Chapter 10, Starr and her mother drive past a police checkpoint set up in response to riots sparked by the murder of their friend and loved one, Khalil, by a police officer. Then Starr hops in the same car with her dad, driving through the same neighborhood where they live. The two share a powerful moment, in which Starr reconciles with the risk and necessity of fighting for Black Liberation, and Maverick accepts that no decision his daughter makes will guarantee her safety in a system which seeks to destroy her. By weaving history and culture into this moment, illustrating the breadth of oppression employed by the U.S. Government, Thomas elevates what would be a personal journey for these characters to an existential question for Black people in America.

Later in the chapter, Maverick is called to act upon this realization, when a young man, DeVante, fleeing gang violence seeks refuge in his shop. Maverick reveals the sacrifices he made to escape gang life and raise his daughter in relative safety; yet the threat of gang violence still looms at his door. Seeing DeVante in the same impossible situation he faced himself, Maverick offers the young man an invaluable opportunity: a job, and a place within his home. At home, Starr's mother Lisa protests Maverick's decision to bring DeVante in, and voices her resolve to move out of the neighborhood. Maverick cannot get free until DeVante gets free; DeVante's freedom requires the freedom of his fellow gang members; and such movements for collective liberation, as recounted mid-chapter, are met with State violence. Thomas shows us that for this family, and for Black people in America, freedom is a dangerous thing.

If they split over this decision Starr says, "That's one more thing one fifteen takes from me"(181). Who is 115, and in this chapter that begins with a police roadblock and ends with 115 breaking her family, what is Thomas saying through Starr in this chapter?

115 is the badge number of the officer who killed Khalil. Thomas shows us, through Starr, that when police murder they not only take a life, but fracture many. By opening with Starr facing a police roadblock and ending the chapter with this statement, Thomas shows us that Starr understands the way trauma has rippled out to affect her family.

Hi, my names Ayub, two things i like to do in my free time is playing basketball with my friends, and playing video games. Playing basketball is a huge hobby of mines and i try to play it as often as i can. I also enjoy Playing video games in my free time. Hiking is another activity i do whenever i get the chance, i usually go with my brothers and its very fun.

The Hate You Give: Starr remembered what her dad taught her "Keep your hands visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to." She used it during the traffic stop with her and her mom, she was visibly scared and showed signs of trauma, she held the door handle tightly and didn't let go, even though they hadn't done anything they were terrified. During this she remembered what happened to Khalil who was killed unjustly by a police officer, which led her to fear more. I think Angie Thomas shared these words to highlight the fear of police brutality the black parents face not just for themselves but also for their children, Star was taught that from a young age even though she hadn't done anything, this shows how even safety was a constant concern for families that were black.

Hello, My name is Somiira and I am a PSEO student. 2 things I like doing in my free time includes reading and going on walks. I am really excited to be reading The Hate You Give book because I have heard many great reviews on this book. 

The Hate You Give: I believe the lines came from Starr’s dad to teach her how to stay safe with police. I think Thomas shows this to point out the fear Black families live with. I believe the author shares history to connect their struggles to the bigger picture of injustice.

Hello, my name is Cale Cross, I am a PSEO student going into senior year of high school. Two things I do in my free time are playing video games with friends, and learning about outer space.

The Hate U Give: The three lines in the chapter was something that Starr learned from her father, Maverick. I believe that Thomas wanted us to read this to show how there are things they people need to do in order to keep themselves safe from police brutality. The information being shared from Thomas when Maverick explains the Black Panthers and the Nat Turner Rebellion to Starr gives us a better connection with how history has played out to allow change, which helps Starr realize that speaking out can help change their lives and their community in a better way. 115 is the badge number from a police officer that had killed Khalil through police brutality. With Starr saying "That's one more thing one fifteen takes from me," allows Thomas to show us how these events affect people, families, and communities in more ways than what it is at face value.

Hello! My name is Mariah and I am currently studying business management. This will be my last year online and I plan to hopefully transfer to a 4 year university. Some things I like to do in my free time include going on walks with my dog, attending workout classes like warrior sculpt, listen to music, and go shopping! I am excited to begin class and see what the rest of the semester will bring. 

The line, "Keep your hands visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to"(165) Maverick is the one speaking to Starr. Star heard these works when she was a kid so she knew what to do in a police stop. Thomas shares these words to let people know the reality of the world and how black families must implement these tactics in their children's head to understand what they can and cannot do when stopped by police offers. Thomas is letting readers know the hard reality and truth not many people are comfortable speaking about. I believe that Thomas brought up Tupac, the Black Panthers, and Nat Turner to show that oppression has been a thing for years and something that needs to be fixed. 115 is the cop who killed Khalil, specifically their badge number is what they identify him as. Thomas speaks how when one person is killed by police brutality, it affects an entire community.

HUG: I am curious how Starr’s parents argument, her mother’s need for safety contrasting with her father’s need to fight, DeVante and other members of her community, and her trauma from Khalil’s death impact her protesting and action in later chapters.

My Introduction & "The Hate U Give"

Sparrow Breuning posted Aug 29, 2025 4:42 PM
Hi everyone! My name is Sparrow and I use any/all pronouns! This is my first year of college at MCTC after taking a gap year, but I've taken some college level classes back in my senior year of high school. I'm a big fan of the arts and I love drawing, painting, writing, and performing. I also like doll collecting and learning about scene culture.

I've read The Hate U Give before, albeit it was back in seventh grade. Even still, I remember a lot of the plot details about the book. 

The lines "Keep your hands visible. No sudden moves. Only speak when spoken to" (165) is Starr's internal monologue, and is said during a police traffic stop. Considering the recent death of her friend Khalil at the hands of police brutality, it not only serves as a reminder of that traumatic memory, but is also a reminder Starr has heard throughout her life when being pulled over by police. She's afraid that something bad will happen to her.

Maverick's discussion with Starr about the Black Panthers, the Nat Turner Rebellion, and Tupac isn't just meant to be a history lesson about Black struggle in America, it's meant to show how even through centuries, Black people are still oppressed both systemically and socially in America. Black communities are disproportionately affected by societal issues such as poverty, unemployment and lack of education because America doesn't give them the same opportunities as White people. It then creates other problems, such as drug selling and addiction, as Maverick explains "The Brendas can't get jobs unless they're clean, and they can't pay for rehab unless they got jobs. When the Khalils get arrested for selling drugs, they either spent most of their life in prison, another billion-dollar industry, or they have a hard time getting a real job and probably start selling drugs again" (170). His point in bringing up these forms of protest and rebellion is to tell Starr (and by extension, us the readers) that social injustice against Black people has been happening for centuries, and Khalil's death is another example of that injustice. It's why he says to Starr that "we can't be silent" (171), because if she doesn't speak out against the police industry now for killing her friend, then nothing will happen, and therefore more lives will be lost.

At the very end of the chapter,  Starr's mom and dad get into an argument about whether or not staying in Garden Heights is a good idea. Starr's thought of "it'll be one more thing One-Fifteen takes from me" (181) is meant to indirectly show both her and her family's stress they're enduring as a result of Khalil's death. One-Fifteen is the badge number of the police officer that killed Khalil. Ever since his death, there's been riots and protests throughout the city, especially close to where Starr's family lives, which is already unsafe. Her dad wants to help out the young people in the neighborhood and give them better opportunities, while her mom is concerned for her kids' safety and wants to move out. Starr overhears this and starts to become concerned that her parents might split up over this issue. This issue has become more prevalent because of the protests, which are happening because of Khalil's death, which happened because of One-Fifteen. It's an indirect way of telling us that if Starr's family falls apart, it's the fault of One-Fifteen.

(I apologize if this discussion is a bit lengthy -- I tend to be a bit of a lengthy writer!)

Hi, My name is Ismail Boqore and i am currently majoring in nursing at metro state university. I love playing basketball and being with my friends. I enjoy learning and look forward to my first year in college. 

On the line 165 "keep your hand visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to" are said by stars's father, named maverick. Starr first heard these words from her dad as a kid when he gave her and seven "the talk" about how to act when the police would stop you. Thomas was showing readers the reality that black parents have to get their children ready for these type of situations that could happen just because of the color of their skin. It wasn't just normal regular advice but a way to protect the kids from those types of situations. This moment shows the challenges that black families face, and shows readers how racism can be. When maverick takes Starr to the shop, he uses that moment to teach her about the rapper Tupac, the black panthers and his past with gang affiliations. Starr learns from Khalil's death that it was apart of something bigger, and an unfair system. Basically Maverick wants her to understand and be prepared to deal with it. The chapter ends with Starr hearing her parents having an argument about moving out the neighborhood. She believes officer 115 (the badge number of the officer) the officer who killed her friend  Khalil is also tearing apart her family. His actions caused the family to have that pain and arguments. Starting at the police roadblock and ending with Starr’s family Spain, the chapter shows us that police violence damages families and communities, not just the person involved.

Savanna Berven-Starr posted Sep 2, 2025 7:21 PM
Hello,

 My name is Savanna. I am a 2nd-year student excited to learn and grow in this course along with my other courses.

 In The Hate You Give, Starr remembered key pieces of information from her childhood and her parents. “Keep your hand visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to.” This is something she had been taught as a young child growing up in a “hood” area. These words were a form of protection, a starting point to being able to make it back home. Use these tactics and you can stay alive. Thomas used these lines to show us as readers how minorities can be pressured into fear and submission to follow all the rules they try and force many of us to follow. It is supposed to help as a survival strategy for those who are often looked down upon. Maverick, who is Starr’s father, speaks about the excellence of Black Panther, Tupac, and Nat Turner and his own experiences with prison and gangs when he was taking her to the store to restock it. He wanted her to understand there is a bigger system and problem behind the death of her friend, and she would need to gain the knowledge and strength to face it. At the end, she mentioned, “That’s one more One-Fifteen take away from me.” One-Fifteen is the officer who shot and killed Kalil when he saw a “gun”; however, it was a hairbrush he was combing his waves with. One-Fifteen has caused so much pain, distress, and anger in Starr’s family and community. It started with police blocking the road, to the killing of Kalil and the downfall of Starr, her mental health, and her family. One tragedy turned their lives upside down; the downfall is the outcome of police brutality. Police brutality doesn’t just stop people from breathing; it damages us, separates us, and divides us.

Hi there, my name is Bailey. I'm coming back to school in my 30's, nervous, but really excited! I'm studying architecture and urban planning. I want to learn more about pedestrian infrastructure and accessibility. Outside of class you'll most likely see me biking around the Twin Cities, as that's one of my favorite things to do. I made the decision to sell my car when moving here, so it's either bike or transit for me. I moved here from Florida a little over a year ago with my partner and two cats, (Spock and Seven). Outside of biking and getting to know the city I spend my time reading, trying new recipes, or finding free things to do. If you have any recommendations for third spaces I'd love to hear about them!

The Hate U Give - Chapter 10

Chapter 10 opens with Starr describing the exhaustion of everyday life, the ongoing riots and policing. Starr and her mother arrive at their neighborhood checkpoint, leading to the unspoken question, do the white neighborhoods also have these checkpoints, or just the black neighborhoods?  Starr is aware of what the police are capable of from first-hand experience with Khalil. "They can easily grab their guns and leave us like Khalil". "All the blood in our bodies pooling on the street for everybody to see". 
Starr is young, and traumatized. While police brutality and violence may have others desensitized, her self narrative of "feeling weak, and pissed off" shows it hurts while she mourns for Khalil and processing what took place. Both of Starr's parents know she's hurting, and both have different recipes for comfort. Starr's mother is reassuring and nurturing, "See baby, everything's fine". Her father's way with realism with his own trauma and connecting the worlds of gang banging and Harry Potter. Bringing it down to a more approachable level, although Starr is already well aware of the realities of growing up in a black neighborhood vs a white one.
During the trip to the warehouse, Maverick turns on some Tupac and asks Starr for her perspective on what "Thug life" means. It's a back-and-forth discussion that opens up to the Black Panthers, the slave rebellion of 1831, tactics of empowering the oppressed. Something I personally picked up on, as my Dad is an immigrant and would often use trips in the car to talk about real things- how America was built on immigrant's backs, yet were treated as less than. Making sure I understood the struggles BIPOC people endure because it's a systemic issue that will take a lot of work to scratch the surface.
The chapter ends with emphasis on 115- another number among the many others who have abused and weaponized their sense of power over others through an inherently racist system. A way for Starr to deduce 115 as a police officer to a number, a statistic. At the end of the night, Starr's parents are having a discussion in the hallway about priorities, the choice being the family or Garden heights. "If they break up, it'll be one more thing 115 takes from me". Emphasizing how one action can send shockwaves through a family and entire community, leaving lasting and far-reaching impacts.

Hello my name is Brenda. I’m talking prereqs at MCTC to get into a sonography program. I have a 2 year old son and I work overnights, so life is definitely busy for me. But i dong my best to balance it all and stay focused.

Even though I’ve seen the movie, reading  chapter 10 still hits hard. It’s scary how Starr and her mom automatically go into survival mode. As a mom my self, I really felt that. The idea of having  to teach my son to stay safe around police one day honestly hurts. I also liked the moment with her dad talking about the black panther and Tupac. It made me think about how important it is to pass down knowledge and strength. He’s straying to guided her and make sure she understands the bigger picture. You can see how much he cares, even it he doesn’t say it directl. This chapter showed how deep the impact of everything was and not just about star but her entire family,

My Take about Week 1, Introductions and "The Hate U Give"
Contains unread posts
Amin Abubakar posted Aug 28, 2025 12:43 PM
Hi everyone, my name is Amin. I am studying Pre- Nursing, and this is my first semester at MCTC. I enjoy cooking for friends, going to the gym and spending time outdoors.

My take about “The Hate U Give” (Chapter 10) by Angie Thomas

For the Police roadblock scene, we see that Starr becomes unsettled due to the trauma she faced losing two people that are close to her and one of them was a boy called Khalil. She said this " They mean the Police can leave us like Khalil. All the Body in our bodies pooling on the street for everybody to see. Our Mouth wide open. Our eyes starting at the sky searching for God" Pg 165. It vividly shows how she witnessed her close friend Khalil death and her reaction during the roadblock explains how she feels uneasy and the unpredictability of the police. The big question is are the Police here to protect us or against us.

 

The lesson of Maverick about history is how he views the world from his standpoint, and how he feels about the Black communities and how his life has been affected by all that went on due to where he lived, his upbringing and his community. Maverick had a father in prison when he was eight years old from being the King Lord, we see that after that he Maverick got recruited to replace his father seat at the age of twelve. He must protect his community and fill his father’s shoes. Also, we see maverick goes to prison for helping one person from going to his third strike which means life imprisonment. We also see how life in prison help shift his focus to his family as that means to him, however the conflict here comes between him choosing his family or his community as we see that at the end of the chapter.

 

At the end of the chapter, we see how Starr feels that the Police “115” has infiltrated her own home and she does not feel safe even there and that because of what they act towards the community. Like his father is protecting the community more than the Police and its show has been vice versa. This adds more to how Starr feels about the law enforcement as they once took away her close friend and now, we see that they are about to break her family too.

Hello everyone my name is Habso,I'm a sophomore and my major is dental assistant.I love spending time with my family outdoors.

1- The lines are spoken by starr's father,Maverick. Starr first heard them when he gave her the "talk" as a child about how to behave if stopped by a police on the road.Thomas shares them to highlight the reality racial profiling and the constant fear black parents feel for their children and are forced to prepare them for racism ahead of time.

2- Maverick shares Tupac's lyrics, Black Panther and Nat Turner history to teach Starr about strength, pride and resistance of oppression her kind face daily.

3- 115 is the white police officer that murdered Khalil in cold blood. Khalil meant everything to Starr he was her family, childhood best friend that she shared a deep bond with.

Hi my name is Salman, few things i enjoy are Playing basketball working out and swimming. Out of all those activities i enjoy playing basketball the most which helps me build communication skills.

The Hate U give: I believe the person who speaks those three lines are Starr's father, and Starr first heard them after the killing of her friend Khalil. In addition to that I believe Thomas shares this with us readers is to given in insight to what feeling or fear black individual's go through about police brutality when stopped by a police officer. Furthermore I suppose 115 is the badge number of the officer that killed Khalil, and what Thomas is saying through Starr is the police brutality has many negative effects on individual who get even a glimpse of it.

Introduction: Hi everyone, my name is Meslah and I am currently a junior in high school doing PSEO. Something that I enjoy doing is spending time with my friends and playing video games.

In chapter 10 of The Hate U Give, Starr and her father sort of continue the discussion Khalil and her were having before he was killed which was about Tupac's "Thug Life" and society. Khalil told her Thug Life stood for "The Hate U Give Infants Fucks Everybody" and shared his interpretation of what it means to him. Khalil said it means how society treats the youth comes back to bite it. Starrs interpretation of what Tupac meant by Thug Life was broader and addressed more than the youth, it addressed the disenfranchised, oppressed, and unlucky. The conversation introduced the nuance in Khalil's situation to Starr who couldn't wrap her head around why Khalil would go and sell drugs while he saw the effect it had on his mother. I think Thomas including this conversation in the book was also aiming to break down the readers narrative around people in Khalils situation where despite his actions being both illegal & immoral it's a means of survival for him.

Hello, my name is Magan and I am a junior in high school. In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer and hanging out with friends.

The Hate u Give: On Page 165, the quote "Keep your hands visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to" is said by either one of her parents. She was taught from a very young age to follow these rules and shows the constant fear black families had to endure.

I think he uses those sources from Tupac, information on the Black Panthers and the Nat Turner rebellion of 1831 because he's teaching Starr that violence against their loved ones is a large part of history against black people. 

As to who 115 is, it might be somebody who took or killed Starr's loved ones, and because of 115, her whole family might break up because of the consequences that come with the killings.
