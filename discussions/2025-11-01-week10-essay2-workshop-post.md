# week 10: essay 2 writing workshop post

subject: how my reading and writing changed for essay 2

I read with a purpose now. On the first pass I get the gist. On the second pass I mark lines that show the author's purpose, tone, and a pattern I can use in my claim. I tag quotes I might use later and add one short note for why each quote matters.

My logs are not summaries anymore. I treat them like mini drafts: claim -> quote -> quick explanation. That made drafting faster. What is still hard for me is picking the best quote and not repeating myself. What got easier is writing topic sentences that point back to my thesis and adding page numbers to quotes.

My goal this week is to add one counterpoint paragraph with a clear reply, then polish transitions so the paragraphs flow. I want my final draft to be focused, with each paragraph doing one job that supports the thesis.
