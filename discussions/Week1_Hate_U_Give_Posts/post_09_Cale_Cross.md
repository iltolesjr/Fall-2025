**Topic:** Introduction and "The Hate U Give"

## Introduction

Hello, my name is Cale Cross, I am a PSEO student going into senior year of high school. Two things I do in my free time are playing video games with friends, and learning about outer space.

## "The Hate U Give" Discussion

The Hate U Give: The three lines in the chapter was something that Starr learned from her father, Maverick. I believe that Thomas wanted us to read this to show how there are things they people need to do in order to keep themselves safe from police brutality. The information being shared from Thomas when Maverick explains the Black Panthers and the Nat Turner Rebellion to Starr gives us a better connection with how history has played out to allow change, which helps Starr realize that speaking out can help change their lives and their community in a better way. 115 is the badge number from a police officer that had killed Khalil through police brutality. With Starr saying "That's one more thing one fifteen takes from me," allows Thomas to show us how these events affect people, families, and communities in more ways than what it is at face value.
