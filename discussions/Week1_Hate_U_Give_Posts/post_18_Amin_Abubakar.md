## "The Hate U Give" Discussion

The Hate U Give” (Chapter 10) by Angie Thomas

For the Police roadblock scene, we see that Starr becomes unsettled due to the trauma she faced losing two people that are close to her and one of them was a boy called Khalil. She said this " They mean the Police can leave us like Khalil. All the Body in our bodies pooling on the street for everybody to see. Our Mouth wide open. Our eyes starting at the sky searching for God" Pg 165. It vividly shows how she witnessed her close friend Khalil death and her reaction during the roadblock explains how she feels uneasy and the unpredictability of the police. The big question is are the Police here to protect us or against us.

The lesson of Maverick about history is how he views the world from his standpoint, and how he feels about the Black communities and how his life has been affected by all that went on due to where he lived, his upbringing and his community. Maverick had a father in prison when he was eight years old from being the King Lord, we see that after that he Maverick got recruited to replace his father seat at the age of twelve. He must protect his community and fill his father’s shoes. Also, we see maverick goes to prison for helping one person from going to his third strike which means life imprisonment. We also see how life in prison help shift his focus to his family as that means to him, however the conflict here comes between him choosing his family or his community as we see that at the end of the chapter.

At the end of the chapter, we see how Starr feels that the Police “115” has infiltrated her own home and she does not feel safe even there and that because of what they act towards the community. Like his father is protecting the community more than the Police and its show has been vice versa. This adds more to how Starr feels about the law enforcement as they once took away her close friend and now, we see that they are about to break her family too.
