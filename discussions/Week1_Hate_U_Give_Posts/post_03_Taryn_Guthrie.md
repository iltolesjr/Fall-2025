## Introduction

Hey guys my name is Taryn, I'm a part-time PSEO student who currently goes to South Highschool

## "The Hate U Give" Discussion

In chapter 10 of The Hate You Give Angie Thomas has the intention of telling her readers how impactful and traumatic Starr witnessing the death of her friend Khalil but also highlighting the fact that systemically black and brown bodies specifically get targeted especially in lower income neighborhoods. Angie Thomas made a good point on page 165 on the top when Starr was talking about gripping the door handle tighter in fear for her life which is especially important considering the history of the police with black men and women. Page 168, THUG life was brought up which I think is important because people always use the term thug without knowing what it means but THUG life meaning The Hate U give Little infants fucks everybody was intentionally put in the book to inform readers of the history of a frequently used word. The way Devonte is brought up in significant because that's the way Maverick was brought up and his dad and Khalil proving that there's a cycle especially growing up with not a lot of money and resources conveniently set up by the government which also intertwines with private prisons and profit off of black and brown bodies. ill continue if i can my computer is gonna die
