The Hate You Give:

## "The Hate U Give" Discussion

Starr remembered what her dad taught her "Keep your hands visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to." She used it during the traffic stop with her and her mom, she was visibly scared and showed signs of trauma, she held the door handle tightly and didn't let go, even though they hadn't done anything they were terrified. During this she remembered what happened to Khalil who was killed unjustly by a police officer, which led her to fear more. I think Angie Thomas shared these words to highlight the fear of police brutality the black parents face not just for themselves but also for their children, Star was taught that from a young age even though she hadn't done anything, this shows how even safety was a constant concern for families that were black.
