## Introduction

Hi, my name is Saabrin and I'm a junior in high school . I'm taking this class because I want to learn more about how books talk about real-world problems. I enjoy drawing and spending time with friends and family.

## "The Hate U Give" Discussion

The phrase "Keep your hands up, don't make any sudden movements, only answer when addressed" was something Starr's father taught her when she was a child. Thomas includes it to indicate how Black children must be taught rules to avoid harm from the police â€” rules that other children don't typically have to worry about.

When Starr's dad talks to her about Tupac, Black Panthers, and Nat Turner, he is trying to teach her about racism and why it still exists. Thomas is trying to get us to know that Black people's problems today have a deep history.

At chapter's close, Starr overhears her parents fight over moving out of their neighborhood. She informs Officer 115 (the officer who has killed Khalil) that he is splitting up her family, as well. This suggests racism and police brutality don't just physically harm individuals they hurt families and communities, as well.
