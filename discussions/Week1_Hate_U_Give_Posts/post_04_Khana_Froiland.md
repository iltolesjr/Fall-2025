## Introduction

Hello! My name is Khana (she/her) and I'm in my first semester at MCTC, pursuing an Associate's Degree in HSER (Pre-Social Work). Academically, my goal is to complete a Master's of Social Work to then work as a therapist. For the past sixteen years I've worked difference service jobs, mostly in restaurants. In my free time I love to play and watch basketball, forage, cook, and watch movies.

the lines? When did Starr first hear them," and why does Thomas share them - to say what to readers? The person who speaks these lines is not explicitly named, but we can imply that Starr has heard them before - likely from an elder who has survived police interaction. Thomas shares these lines to show readers that Starr has been taught the danger of police in her community from a young age.

(Maverick) takes her with him to restock his store and shares lyrics from Tupac's "Keep ya Head up," information on the Black Panthers and the Nat Turner rebellion of 1831, and more of his own story being gang-affiliated and locked up. Why? What is Thomas doing by sharing this information in the middle of the chapter?

Thomas shares personal, political, cultural, and historical examples of Black Resistance to White Supremacy in a conversation between a father, Maverick, and his daughter, Starr. Thomas places these lessons in the middle of Chapter 10 to illustrate the crossroads at which this family sits: in the wake of police murder of their loved one, will they flee Garden Heights or stay and fight for their neighborhood? What is the right thing to do, and is there any path towards safety or freedom for Black people in America?

Early in Chapter 10, Starr and her mother drive past a police checkpoint set up in response to riots sparked by the murder of their friend and loved one, Khalil, by a police officer. Then Starr hops in the same car with her dad, driving through the same neighborhood where they live. The two share a powerful moment, in which Starr reconciles with the risk and necessity of fighting for Black Liberation, and Maverick accepts that no decision his daughter makes will guarantee her safety in a system which seeks to destroy her. By weaving history and culture into this moment, illustrating the breadth of oppression employed by the U.S. Government, Thomas elevates what would be a personal journey for these characters to an existential question for Black people in America.

Later in the chapter, Maverick is called to act upon this realization, when a young man, DeVante, fleeing gang violence seeks refuge in his shop. Maverick reveals the sacrifices he made to escape gang life and raise his daughter in relative safety; yet the threat of gang violence still looms at his door. Seeing DeVante in the same impossible situation he faced himself, Maverick offers the young man an invaluable opportunity: a job, and a place within his home. At home, Starr's mother Lisa protests Maverick's decision to bring DeVante in, and voices her resolve to move out of the neighborhood. Maverick cannot get free until DeVante gets free; DeVante's freedom requires the freedom of his fellow gang members; and such movements for collective liberation, as recounted mid-chapter, are met with State violence. Thomas shows us that for this family, and for Black people in America, freedom is a dangerous thing.

If they split over this decision Starr says, "That's one more thing one fifteen takes from me"(181). Who is 115, and in this chapter that begins with a police roadblock and ends with 115 breaking her family, what is Thomas saying through Starr in this chapter?

115 is the badge number of the officer who killed Khalil. Thomas shows us, through Starr, that when police murder they not only take a life, but fracture many. By opening with Starr facing a police roadblock and ending the chapter with this statement, Thomas shows us that Starr understands the way trauma has rippled out to affect her family.
