## "The Hate U Give" Discussion

The Hate U give: I believe the person who speaks those three lines are Starr's father, and Starr first heard them after the killing of her friend Khalil. In addition to that I believe Thomas shares this with us readers is to given in insight to what feeling or fear black individual's go through about police brutality when stopped by a police officer. Furthermore I suppose 115 is the badge number of the officer that killed Khalil, and what Thomas is saying through Starr is the police brutality has many negative effects on individual who get even a glimpse of it.
