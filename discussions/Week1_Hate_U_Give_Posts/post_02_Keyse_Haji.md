## Introduction

Hi, my name is Keyse Haji. I am currently a senior in high school, and I plan to major in cardiology in the future. This is my second semester at MCTC, and I’m really excited to keep learning here. My current favorite show is Swat on Netflix, and one of my favorite books is Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. I also enjoy playing FIFA, and I’m part of my school’s soccer team. I recently made varsity, which I’m very proud of. When it comes to food, I like so many things that it’s hard to choose a favorite, but pizza is definitely near the top.

## "The Hate U Give" Discussion

Who says the lines “Keep your hands visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to”?

Momma says, “Keep your hands visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to.”

When did Starr first hear them?

She hears them from her momma as they get stopped at a police roadblock. Starr gets really nervous, saying it “grabbed my heart and twisted it,” because she remembers what happened to Khalil when he was pulled over by the police.

Why does Thomas include these lines? What is she trying to say to readers?

I think Thomas is trying to communicate that Black people and other minorities are forced to live by rules like this to survive encounters with police. It shows how dangerous and scary something as simple as a traffic stop can be. This is Thomas showing readers the reality that families actually have to teach their kids these survival rules so they don’t get killed.

Why does Thomas include Tupac’s lyrics, the Black Panthers, the Nat Turner rebellion, and Maverick’s gang story here in the middle of the chapter?

It shows that Black people have always tried different ways to fight back against oppression and find justice. From music like Tupac’s rap, to rebellions to community groups like the Panthers, people have looked for ways to resist racism and unfair treatment. Maverick even shares his own story of being in a gang to explain how some young people look for belonging and power when they feel powerless in society. Thomas puts this in the middle of the chapter to connect the past and the present and to show that these struggles are not new; they've been happening for generations. Daddy says, “Exactly. We can’t be silent,” which means people must keep speaking up and pushing back.

What is the effect on the reader, and how does it connect to the bigger themes of injustice?

The effect on the reader is that it makes us realize injustice is still around and hasn’t gone away, even if it looks different now. It connects to the bigger theme by showing that racism has deep roots in history, and people are still finding ways to survive, cope, and resist it today. It also makes readers think about how they should not be silent when facing unfairness.

Who is “One-Fifteen” (115)?

One-Fifteen is the police officer who shot and killed Khalil.

When Starr says, “That’s one more thing One-Fifteen takes from me,” what does she mean?

She means her family. The shooting already took her friend Khalil’s life, and now the stress of it is starting to tear her parents apart.

How does Thomas show that police violence doesn’t just kill, it also divides families and communities?

She shows this because Starr’s parents are starting to fight more than before. They used to talk about moving but never got serious about it, but after Khalil’s death, they argued deeply about whether to leave the neighborhood or stay. This shows how violence in the community puts families on edge and can break them apart. It also shows that police brutality doesn’t just affect one person; it spreads pain through whole families and neighborhoods.
