## "The Hate U Give" Discussion

On the line 165 "keep your hand visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to" are said by stars's father, named maverick. Starr first heard these words from her dad as a kid when he gave her and seven "the talk" about how to act when the police would stop you. Thomas was showing readers the reality that black parents have to get their children ready for these type of situations that could happen just because of the color of their skin. It wasn't just normal regular advice but a way to protect the kids from those types of situations. This moment shows the challenges that black families face, and shows readers how racism can be. When maverick takes Starr to the shop, he uses that moment to teach her about the rapper Tupac, the black panthers and his past with gang affiliations. Starr learns from Khalil's death that it was apart of something bigger, and an unfair system. Basically Maverick wants her to understand and be prepared to deal with it. The chapter ends with Starr hearing her parents having an argument about moving out the neighborhood. She believes officer 115 (the badge number of the officer) the officer who killed her friend  Khalil is also tearing apart her family. His actions caused the family to have that pain and arguments. Starting at the police roadblock and ending with Starr’s family Spain, the chapter shows us that police violence damages families and communities, not just the person involved.

Hello,

My name is Savanna. I am a 2nd-year student excited to learn and grow in this course along with my other courses.

In The Hate You Give, Starr remembered key pieces of information from her childhood and her parents. “Keep your hand visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to.” This is something she had been taught as a young child growing up in a “hood” area. These words were a form of protection, a starting point to being able to make it back home. Use these tactics and you can stay alive. Thomas used these lines to show us as readers how minorities can be pressured into fear and submission to follow all the rules they try and force many of us to follow. It is supposed to help as a survival strategy for those who are often looked down upon. Maverick, who is Starr’s father, speaks about the excellence of Black Panther, Tupac, and Nat Turner and his own experiences with prison and gangs when he was taking her to the store to restock it. He wanted her to understand there is a bigger system and problem behind the death of her friend, and she would need to gain the knowledge and strength to face it. At the end, she mentioned, “That’s one more One-Fifteen take away from me.” One-Fifteen is the officer who shot and killed Kalil when he saw a “gun”; however, it was a hairbrush he was combing his waves with. One-Fifteen has caused so much pain, distress, and anger in Starr’s family and community. It started with police blocking the road, to the killing of Kalil and the downfall of Starr, her mental health, and her family. One tragedy turned their lives upside down; the downfall is the outcome of police brutality. Police brutality doesn’t just stop people from breathing; it damages us, separates us, and divides us.
