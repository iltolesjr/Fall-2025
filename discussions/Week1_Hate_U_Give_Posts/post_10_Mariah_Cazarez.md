## Introduction

Hello! My name is Mariah and I am currently studying business management. This will be my last year online and I plan to hopefully transfer to a 4 year university. Some things I like to do in my free time include going on walks with my dog, attending workout classes like warrior sculpt, listen to music, and go shopping! I am excited to begin class and see what the rest of the semester will bring.

## "The Hate U Give" Discussion

Maverick is the one speaking to Starr. Star heard these works when she was a kid so she knew what to do in a police stop. Thomas shares these words to let people know the reality of the world and how black families must implement these tactics in their children's head to understand what they can and cannot do when stopped by police offers. Thomas is letting readers know the hard reality and truth not many people are comfortable speaking about. I believe that Thomas brought up Tupac, the Black Panthers, and Nat Turner to show that oppression has been a thing for years and something that needs to be fixed. 115 is the cop who killed Khalil, specifically their badge number is what they identify him as. Thomas speaks how when one person is killed by police brutality, it affects an entire community.
