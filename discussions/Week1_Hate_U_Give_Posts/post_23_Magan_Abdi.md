## Introduction

Hello, my name is Magan and I am a junior in high school. In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer and hanging out with friends.

## "The Hate U Give" Discussion

The Hate u Give: On Page 165, the quote "Keep your hands visible, no sudden moves, only speak when spoken to" is said by either one of her parents. She was taught from a very young age to follow these rules and shows the constant fear black families had to endure.

I think he uses those sources from Tupac, information on the Black Panthers and the Nat Turner rebellion of 1831 because he's teaching Starr that violence against their loved ones is a large part of history against black people.

As to who 115 is, it might be somebody who took or killed Starr's loved ones, and because of 115, her whole family might break up because of the consequences that come with the killings.
