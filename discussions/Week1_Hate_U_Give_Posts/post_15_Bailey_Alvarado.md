## Introduction

Hi there, my name is Bailey. I'm coming back to school in my 30's, nervous, but really excited! I'm studying architecture and urban planning. I want to learn more about pedestrian infrastructure and accessibility. Outside of class you'll most likely see me biking around the Twin Cities, as that's one of my favorite things to do. I made the decision to sell my car when moving here, so it's either bike or transit for me. I moved here from Florida a little over a year ago with my partner and two cats, (Spock and Seven). Outside of biking and getting to know the city I spend my time reading, trying new recipes, or finding free things to do. If you have any recommendations for third spaces I'd love to hear about them!

## "The Hate U Give" Discussion

The Hate U Give - Chapter 10

Chapter 10 opens with Starr describing the exhaustion of everyday life, the ongoing riots and policing. Starr and her mother arrive at their neighborhood checkpoint, leading to the unspoken question, do the white neighborhoods also have these checkpoints, or just the black neighborhoods?  Starr is aware of what the police are capable of from first-hand experience with Khalil. "They can easily grab their guns and leave us like Khalil". "All the blood in our bodies pooling on the street for everybody to see".

Starr is young, and traumatized. While police brutality and violence may have others desensitized, her self narrative of "feeling weak, and pissed off" shows it hurts while she mourns for Khalil and processing what took place. Both of Starr's parents know she's hurting, and both have different recipes for comfort. Starr's mother is reassuring and nurturing, "See baby, everything's fine". Her father's way with realism with his own trauma and connecting the worlds of gang banging and Harry Potter. Bringing it down to a more approachable level, although Starr is already well aware of the realities of growing up in a black neighborhood vs a white one.

During the trip to the warehouse, Maverick turns on some Tupac and asks Starr for her perspective on what "Thug life" means. It's a back-and-forth discussion that opens up to the Black Panthers, the slave rebellion of 1831, tactics of empowering the oppressed. Something I personally picked up on, as my Dad is an immigrant and would often use trips in the car to talk about real things- how America was built on immigrant's backs, yet were treated as less than. Making sure I understood the struggles BIPOC people endure because it's a systemic issue that will take a lot of work to scratch the surface.

The chapter ends with emphasis on 115- another number among the many others who have abused and weaponized their sense of power over others through an inherently racist system. A way for Starr to deduce 115 as a police officer to a number, a statistic. At the end of the night, Starr's parents are having a discussion in the hallway about priorities, the choice being the family or Garden heights. "If they break up, it'll be one more thing 115 takes from me". Emphasizing how one action can send shockwaves through a family and entire community, leaving lasting and far-reaching impacts.
