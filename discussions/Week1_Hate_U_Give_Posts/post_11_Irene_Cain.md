**Topic:** Introduction and "The Hate U Give"

## Introduction

My name is Irene and I am a junior in high school. I really like reading and weightlifting.

## "The Hate U Give" Discussion

HUG: I am curious how Starr’s parents argument, her mother’s need for safety contrasting with her father’s need to fight, DeVante and other members of her community, and her trauma from Khalil’s death impact her protesting and action in later chapters.
