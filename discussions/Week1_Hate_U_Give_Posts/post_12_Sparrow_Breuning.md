**Topic:** Introduction and "The Hate U Give"

## Introduction

Hi everyone! My name is Sparrow and I use any/all pronouns! This is my first year of college at MCTC after taking a gap year, but I've taken some college level classes back in my senior year of high school. I'm a big fan of the arts and I love drawing, painting, writing, and performing. I also like doll collecting and learning about scene culture.

I've read

## "The Hate U Give" Discussion

The Hate U Give before, albeit it was back in seventh grade. Even still, I remember a lot of the plot details about the book.

The lines "Keep your hands visible. No sudden moves. Only speak when spoken to" (165) is Starr's internal monologue, and is said during a police traffic stop. Considering the recent death of her friend Khalil at the hands of police brutality, it not only serves as a reminder of that traumatic memory, but is also a reminder Starr has heard throughout her life when being pulled over by police. She's afraid that something bad will happen to her.

Maverick's discussion with Starr about the Black Panthers, the Nat Turner Rebellion, and Tupac isn't just meant to be a history lesson about Black struggle in America, it's meant to show how even through centuries, Black people are still oppressed both systemically and socially in America. Black communities are disproportionately affected by societal issues such as poverty, unemployment and lack of education because America doesn't give them the same opportunities as White people. It then creates other problems, such as drug selling and addiction, as Maverick explains "The Brendas can't get jobs unless they're clean, and they can't pay for rehab unless they got jobs. When the Khalils get arrested for selling drugs, they either spent most of their life in prison, another billion-dollar industry, or they have a hard time getting a real job and probably start selling drugs again" (170). His point in bringing up these forms of protest and rebellion is to tell Starr (and by extension, us the readers) that social injustice against Black people has been happening for centuries, and Khalil's death is another example of that injustice. It's why he says to Starr that "we can't be silent" (171), because if she doesn't speak out against the police industry now for killing her friend, then nothing will happen, and therefore more lives will be lost.

At the very end of the chapter,  Starr's mom and dad get into an argument about whether or not staying in Garden Heights is a good idea. Starr's thought of "it'll be one more thing One-Fifteen takes from me" (181) is meant to indirectly show both her and her family's stress they're enduring as a result of Khalil's death. One-Fifteen is the badge number of the police officer that killed Khalil. Ever since his death, there's been riots and protests throughout the city, especially close to where Starr's family lives, which is already unsafe. Her dad wants to help out the young people in the neighborhood and give them better opportunities, while her mom is concerned for her kids' safety and wants to move out. Starr overhears this and starts to become concerned that her parents might split up over this issue. This issue has become more prevalent because of the protests, which are happening because of Khalil's death, which happened because of One-Fifteen. It's an indirect way of telling us that if Starr's family falls apart, it's the fault of One-Fifteen.

(I apologize if this discussion is a bit lengthy -- I tend to be a bit of a lengthy writer!)
