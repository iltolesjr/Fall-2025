## Introduction

Introduction: Hi everyone, my name is Meslah and I am currently a junior in high school doing PSEO. Something that I enjoy doing is spending time with my friends and playing video games.

## "The Hate U Give" Discussion

In chapter 10 of The Hate U Give, Starr and her father sort of continue the discussion Khalil and her were having before he was killed which was about Tupac's "Thug Life" and society. Khalil told her Thug Life stood for "The Hate U Give Infants Fucks Everybody" and shared his interpretation of what it means to him. Khalil said it means how society treats the youth comes back to bite it. Starrs interpretation of what Tupac meant by Thug Life was broader and addressed more than the youth, it addressed the disenfranchised, oppressed, and unlucky. The conversation introduced the nuance in Khalil's situation to Starr who couldn't wrap her head around why Khalil would go and sell drugs while he saw the effect it had on his mother. I think Thomas including this conversation in the book was also aiming to break down the readers narrative around people in Khalils situation where despite his actions being both illegal & immoral it's a means of survival for him.
