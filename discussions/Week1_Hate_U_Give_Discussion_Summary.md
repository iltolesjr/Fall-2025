### 15. and The Hate U Give
Bailey Alvarado - Aug 28, 2025 10:51 AM

**Introduction:**
Hi there, my name is Bailey. I'm coming back to school in my 30's, nervous, but really excited! I'm studying architecture and urban planning. I want to learn more about pedestrian infrastructure and accessibility. Outside of class you'll most likely see me biking around the Twin Cities, as that's one of my favorite things to do. I made the decision to sell my car when moving here, so it's either bike or transit for me. I moved here from Florida a little over a year ago with my partner and two cats, (Spock and Seven). Outside of biking and getting to know the city I spend my time reading, trying new recipes, or finding free things to do. If you have any recommendations for third spaces I'd love to hear about them!

**Key Points from Book Discussion:**
The Hate U Give - Chapter 10

Chapter 10 opens with Starr describing the exhaustion of everyday life, the ongoing riots and policing. Starr and her mother arrive at their neighborhood checkpoint, leading to the unspoken question, do the white neighborhoods also have these checkpoints, or just the bl...

**Key Points from Book Discussion:**
Even though I’ve seen the movie, reading  chapter 10 still hits hard. It’s scary how Starr and her mom automatically go into survival mode. As a mom my self, I really felt that. The idea of having  to teach my son to stay safe around police one day honestly hurts. I also liked the moment with her da...
