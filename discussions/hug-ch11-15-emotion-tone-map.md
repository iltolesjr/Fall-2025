## 1. Core Emotional Arc (Macro)

| Phase | Approx Chapters | Dominant Interior Feeling | Surface Performance | Underlying Conflict | Transition Signal |
|-------|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Compression | Early 11 | Numb vigilance (holding breath) | Measured, polite responses | Fear of saying a mis-framable word | Short interior fragments / long exterior sentences |
| Familial Friction | Mid 11–12 | Protective anxiety + loyalty tension | Half-pauses, hedging | Whose definition of “safe” matters | Interrupted dialogue beats |
| Identity Calibration | 12–13 | Split-self fatigue (school vs home) | Code-switched diction | Maintaining credibility in two worlds | Self-monitoring verbs (thinking, gauging) |
| Media Exposure Pressure | 13–14 | Anticipatory stress + moral obligation | Controlled statements | Risk of Khalil’s story being hijacked | Internal corrections after external speech |
| Pivot Toward Agency | 14–15 | Emerging resolve layered with residual fear | Firmer declarative lines | Cost-benefit recalculated around duty | Fewer hedges; purposeful tone shift |

## 2. Micro Emotional States by Interaction Type

| Interaction Type | Micro Feeling | Craft Signals | Your Writing Tone | Personal Anecdote Bridge Template |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| Parent discussion | Tense care | Overlapping sentences / softened modal verbs | Empathetic analytic (not accusatory) | "In my family a pause like that meant… which reframes the hesitation as…" |
| Uncle / authority figure | Conflicted trust | Procedural vocabulary vs emotional interior | Analytical distance + subtle skepticism | "Hearing a 'protocol' answer while feeling ___ primes me to read his wording as…" |
| Internal rehearsal before speaking | Cognitive load | Fragmented interior syntax vs polished exterior | Precise, observing labor | "That mental pre-editing echoes times I trimmed a word to neutralize risk…" |
| Media framing moment | Frustrated containment | Paraphrased summary undercuts nuance | Critical but controlled | "When I watched a headline flatten ___, I felt the same squeeze the narration renders through…" |
| Decision shift (toward agency) | Layered courage (courage + fear coexisting) | Reduction in filler / more declaratives | Balanced: acknowledge fear persists | "Choosing to act while fear stays present matches moments when I…" |

## 3. Feeling → Craft → Analysis Translation Grid

| Feeling Label | Not Just “I Feel…” | Craft Mechanism to Cite | Analytical Verb Options | Theme Connection |
|---------------|--------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Vigilance | Mental scanning; predictive filtering | Internal/external register contrast | calibrates, triages, filters | Surveillance / self-preservation |
| Fatigue | Layered emotional exhaustion | Length / rhythm of sentences | compresses, thins, attenuates | Sustainability of witness labor |
| Containment | Holding strong emotion inside a small verbal space | Lexical restraint / neutral diction | masks, modulates, edges | Credibility politics |
| Tensioned Care | Love expressed as caution | Interruptions / hedging modals | negotiates, tempers, dilutes | Collective risk calculus |
| Resolute Agency | Action minus full safety | Declarative shift / reduced hedges | reclaims, asserts, repositions | Voice as negotiated duty |

## 4. Sample Annotated Paragraph (Safety Angle) – WITH PLACEHOLDERS

> Hook: The pause at the kitchen table feels less like indecision than a silent inventory of threats. Starr’s mother’s brief silence (replace with [FRAG 1]) isn’t passivity; it **negotiates** exposure. Thomas juxtaposes that measured outward calm with Starr’s splintered inner thoughts (replace with [FRAG 2]), a contrast that **calibrates** the emotional cost of even *considering* speech. Before I ever talked publicly about a tense encounter, I pre-cut words so nothing could be twisted; that memory sharpens how the scene frames caution as protective activism rather than fear. The layered interruptions map a family converting love into a risk algorithm—each half-finished sentence is a variable. This reframes “finding voice” as collective logistics, not spontaneous bravery.

Emotion Tags: (Containment → Vigilance → Tensioned Care)

## 5. Sample Annotated Paragraph (Gatekeeping Angle) – WITH PLACEHOLDERS

> Hook: The moment a label is floated (insert [LABEL FRAG]) the narrative field narrows—Starr begins defending *categories* before recounting *events*. Thomas renders her interior correction (insert [PARA FRAG]) right after the external paraphrase, a structural **counter-script** that **reclaims** semantic space the broadcast format just **compressed**. I’ve watched a community story shrink into a sensational single word; that experience makes the timing of her mental revision read as anticipatory labor, not overthinking. The novel turns cognition into resistance: every silent retranslation preserves Khalil from discursive erasure. Gatekeeping here isn’t censorship—it’s pre-loading moral assumptions the witness must spend emotional calories undoing. How do we evaluate credibility when so much witness energy is burned on neutralization before truth advances?

Emotion Tags: (Vigilance → Fatigue → Containment → Agency)

## 6. Editing Mood Guide (How YOU Can Match Tone While Revising)

| Draft Section | Target Emotional Color | Avoid | Use | Quick Self-Check |
|---------------|-----------------------|-------|-----|------------------|
| Hooks | Compressed tension (no melodrama) | Over-detailed backstory | One precise sensory or timing detail | Does first sentence contain an interpretive noun (e.g., calculus, filter, compression)? |
| Claim | Controlled confidence | Vague "I think" | Mechanism + effect + theme | Can someone disagree? |
| Evidence Analysis | Analytical empathy | Plot restatement | Mechanism verbs (filters/modulates) | Is HOW before WHY? |
| Anecdote Bridge | Grounded resonance | Trauma spectacle | 1 snapshot + 1 interpretive verb | Pivot back within 1 sentence? |
| Synthesis | Expansive but disciplined | Moralizing generalities | Abstraction nouns (surveillance, narrative economy) | New conceptual noun introduced? |
| Question | Genuine inquiry | Binary yes/no | How / Where / To what extent | Requires textual return? |

## 7. Feeling Vocabulary Bank (Use Instead of Generic Words)

| Replace "feel" with | For… | Example Frame |
|---------------------|-------|---------------|
| register recoil | moment of pulling language back | "A register recoil happens when she trims…" |
| semantic narrowing | label reduces complexity | "The semantic narrowing forces her to…" |
| cognitive triage | prioritizing which thought to voice | "Her cognitive triage foregrounds safety over fullness…" |
| tonal calibration | adjusting emotional pitch | "Tonal calibration becomes a survival craft move…" |
| affective containment | controlled emotional storage | "Affective containment keeps credibility intact…" |

## 8. Personal Anecdote Plug-In Scaffold

Structure: SNAPSHOT → INTERPRETIVE VERB → PIVOT.
Template: "In one hallway conversation a single adjective shifted how an adult read me; that snap taught me rhetorical trimming is preemptive protection. This primes me to read Starr’s [mechanism] as strategic risk filtering, not indecision."

*Next Step Suggestion*: Choose which paragraph model (Safety or Gatekeeping) you want fully fleshed out with your chosen anecdote, and provide a 1–2 sentence anecdote draft. I’ll integrate it and return a polish-ready version.
