## 🎨 Script Features Explained

### Color-Coded Output
All scripts use colors to make output easier to read:
- **🟢 Green**: Step headers and success messages
- **🔵 Blue**: Information messages
- **🟡 Yellow**: Warnings and prompts
- **🟣 Magenta**: Screenshot required markers (📸)
- **🔴 Red**: Error messages

### Screenshot Prompts
Every script pauses at screenshot points with:
```
📸 SCREENSHOT REQUIRED: Description of what to capture
Press Enter after taking the screenshot to continue...
```

### Automatic Backups
Scripts create backups of important files before modifying them:
- `/etc/hosts` → `/etc/hosts.backup.YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` → `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.backup`

### Error Handling
- Scripts check for root/sudo privileges
- Commands include error checking with `|| true` where appropriate
- Clear error messages guide troubleshooting

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Ideas)

If you want to extend this in the future:

1. **Add more labs** as they're assigned:
   - Create `week3-labX.sh` scripts
   - Update menu in `run-all-labs.sh`
   - Add documentation to QUICK-REFERENCE.md

2. **Create lab templates** for new assignments:
   - Copy an existing script
   - Modify steps for new lab
   - Update documentation

3. **Add validation checks**:
   - Verify services are running
   - Check if ports are open
   - Test connectivity automatically

4. **Create video tutorials**:
   - Screen recording of running the scripts
   - Walkthrough of taking screenshots
   - Submission document creation

5. **Add progress tracking**:
   - Log which labs completed
   - Track time spent per lab
   - Generate completion reports

## 🎓 Academic Integrity Note

These scripts are **learning tools** designed to:
- Help you understand the commands
- Ensure consistent lab execution
- Save time on repetitive tasks
- Reduce typing errors

You are still responsible for:
- **Understanding what each command does**
- **Explaining steps in your submission**
- **Demonstrating learning in your report**
- **Taking your own screenshots**
- **Writing original explanations**

The scripts automate execution, but **you must demonstrate understanding** in your submission.
