## 🗂️ Organization Logic

### By Week
- `week2-lab1-hostname.sh` - Week 2, Lab 1
- `week2-lab2-software-managers.sh` - Week 2, Lab 2

### By Lab Name
- `lennox-server-complete-setup.sh` - Lennox Server lab
- `collect-lennox-outputs.sh` - Lennox outputs collection

### Special Files
- `run-all-labs.sh` - Menu to run any lab
- `*.md` files - Documentation and guides

## 🎯 Quick Access Guide

### Want to run a lab?
```bash
cd lab-assignments
sudo ./run-all-labs.sh  # Interactive menu
```

### Want to run a specific lab directly?
```bash
cd lab-assignments
sudo ./week2-lab1-hostname.sh          # Week 2 Lab 1
sudo ./week2-lab2-software-managers.sh # Week 2 Lab 2
sudo ./lennox-server-complete-setup.sh # Lennox Server
```

### Want to collect outputs?
```bash
cd lab-assignments
sudo ./collect-lennox-outputs.sh
# Creates: lennox-lab-outputs.txt
```

### Want to learn more?
```bash
cd lab-assignments
cat README.md                    # Start here
cat QUICK-REFERENCE.md          # Commands and tips
cat USAGE-EXAMPLES.md           # Detailed examples
cat IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md   # Full summary
```

## 📂 Integration with Existing Structure

The lab-assignments folder integrates seamlessly with the existing repository:

```
Fall-2025/
├── assignments/
│   └── ITEC-1475/
│       ├── vcenter-lab-hostname.md            # ← Original lab instructions
│       ├── vcenter-lab-software-managers.md   # ← Original lab instructions
│       ├── lennox-server-setup.md             # ← Original lab instructions
│       └── scripts/
│           └── collect_lennox_outputs.sh      # ← Original collection script
│
└── lab-assignments/                            # ← NEW automated scripts
    ├── README.md                               # ← Quick start
    ├── week2-lab1-hostname.sh                  # ← Automated version
    ├── week2-lab2-software-managers.sh         # ← Automated version
    └── lennox-server-complete-setup.sh         # ← Automated version
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Original instructions remain in `assignments/ITEC-1475/`
- ✅ New automated scripts in `lab-assignments/` on front page
- ✅ No existing files were modified (except README.md)
- ✅ Both can be used independently

## 🔍 Finding Specific Content

### Looking for commands?
→ **QUICK-REFERENCE.md** - All commands organized by lab

### Looking for examples?
→ **USAGE-EXAMPLES.md** - Sample outputs and walkthroughs

### Looking for setup help?
→ **README.md** - Getting started guide

### Looking for lab scripts?
→ `*.sh` files - Executable scripts for each lab

### Looking for original instructions?
→ `../assignments/ITEC-1475/*.md` - Original lab documents

## 📝 Naming Conventions

### Scripts
- `week[N]-lab[X]-[name].sh` - Week-based labs
- `[labname]-[purpose].sh` - Name-based labs
- `run-all-labs.sh` - Special menu script

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Overview (always named this)
- `[PURPOSE]-[TYPE].md` - Descriptive naming
  - QUICK-REFERENCE.md
  - USAGE-EXAMPLES.md
  - IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md

## 🎓 Usage Patterns

### For First Time Users
1. Read `README.md`
2. Check `QUICK-REFERENCE.md`
3. Run `sudo ./run-all-labs.sh`

5. Follow prompts

### For Experienced Users
1. Run specific script directly
2. Skip menu, go straight to lab
3. Use QUICK-REFERENCE for commands
4. Collect outputs when done

### For Documentation Readers
1. Start with `README.md`
2. Browse `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` for specific info
3. Check `USAGE-EXAMPLES.md` for details
4. Review `IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` for overview
