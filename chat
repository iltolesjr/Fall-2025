Thanks for sharing the details of your homework assignment. Here's a structured step-by-step guide for completing the lab. You can directly copy and paste the commands provided below to complete the tasks:

### 1. Change the Hostname
```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname <YourStarID>-mint
hostnamectl
```
Replace `<YourStarID>` with your actual StarID (e.g., `gf4321yk`).

Take a screenshot showing the new hostname displayed by the `hostnamectl` command.

---

### 2. Find Your IP Address
```bash
ip a
```
Look for the IP address associated with your system (e.g., `10.14.75.205`) under the section starting with `inet`.

Take a screenshot showing the IP address output.

---

### 3. Update the `/etc/hosts` File
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
Modify the file as follows:
1. Update the second line to include your new hostname and IP address.
2. Add a new line with your system's IP address and hostname.

Example updated `/etc/hosts` file:
```
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       <YourStarID>-mint
<YourIPAddress> <YourStarID>-mint
```
Replace `<YourStarID>` with your StarID and `<YourIPAddress>` with your system IP.

Save and exit by pressing `CTRL-X`, then `Y`, and `ENTER`.

To verify the changes:
```bash
cat /etc/hosts
```
Take a screenshot showing the updated `/etc/hosts` file.

---

### 4. Share and Add Group Members to `/etc/hosts`
After posting your StarID and IP address in the group discussion, update your `/etc/hosts` file to include the IP addresses and hostnames of your group members. Example:
```
127.0.0.1       localhost
127.0.1.1       <YourStarID>-mint
10.14.75.205    gf4321yk-mint
10.14.75.206    ab1234cd-mint
10.14.75.207    ef5678gh-mint
```
Run the following command to verify:
```bash
cat /etc/hosts
```
Take a screenshot of the updated file.

---

### 5. Ping Other Systems
For each group member, ping their system to check connectivity:
```bash
ping -c 2 <GroupMemberHostname>
```
Example:
```bash
ping -c 2 gf4321yk-mint
```
Take a screenshot showing the successful ping results for each group member.

---

### 6. Turn Off the System
Ensure you leave the system running so others can ping your system.

---

### Submission
Once all tasks are completed:
- Combine all screenshots into a single document.
- Ensure each task is labeled and the screenshots are clear.
- Submit the document to the appropriate assignment folder.
