On-Campus Lab: Make a Working Linux System
20 / 20

Overall Feedback
UPDATE: 2025-09-15 Looks great!

UPDATE: 2025-09-14 I was grading your second lab assignment and noticed several things wrong. In looking into the issue, I came back to this lab and realized that you showed a screenshot of a system that wasn't yours: you're showing the 1475Mint-uc2155oo system, that belongs to Eric. I then went to the vCenter and found that while you have a virtual computer defined, it doesn't have Linux Mint installed on it. When you get Mint installed in the virtual machine in the vCenter and resubmit, I'll update your grade. Remember, if you're having difficulties with these labs, please schedule time to meet with me as it says in the "Syllabus & Connect" module.

Normally I want the screenshot with the tab open to the virtual machine's console, showing Mint running (fully installed), but I can zoom in enough on your PDF to see it's got an "ITEC Student" login prompt which proves the install worked. ðŸ˜‰

vCenter Lab: Change the Hostname

UPDATE: 2025-09-21 You need to start with a clean document, copy and paste the questions from the lab, and then only paste the one screenshot I ask for. You have some screenshots that show the web interface of the vCenter and some that show a VM you're running locally on your computer in VMware workstation; I know this because of the IP address your system has: 192.168.209.128 -- that's not an IP that the vCenter provided. If you're trying your pings from that local virtual machine,  you won't be able to reach the private network in the vCenter and that's why they are failing.

It really would be best if you scheduled a Zoom session for us to connect and I can help clean-up and clarify all these issues for you. You'll definitely need things running, in the vCenter, to be able to do the rest of the labs in this course.

UPDATE: 2025-09-15

#1 looks good

For #2, I'm not seeing the ip a command I asked for to show your IP address.

For #3, the IP address you're showing for your system is actually the IP address for my system.

For #4, the pings don't work because you don't have entries for that ex9784un-mint system, or others (like mine) added to your /etc/hosts file.

Several things about this lab seemed incorrect so I looked into this more. First, the title bar in VMware Workstation is showing "Ubuntu 64-bit" rather than Linux Mint. I'm also not seeing a tab showing that you're connected to the ITEC vCenter which tells me the system you're showing is a local VM to your machine, which also explains why pings weren't working.

In trying to figure things out I went back and looked at your first lab and found that the screenshot you provided was for some other student's system.

Finally, what you submitted very much looks like responses from an AI system. AI use is fine to learn, but you cannot use it to do your homework.

If you do the lab correctly, in the ITEC vCenter, I'll update your grade.

vCenter: Lab Different Desktops

Overall Feedback
Hey Ira, I'm not sure what happened with your PDF, but everything kept sliding to the right as I scrolled down and I didn't see descriptions of what you were comparing for each desktop. Also, by the time it got to question 10 about which one you liked best and what you learned from the exercise, the whole paragraph seems cut-off in the middle so I'm not entirely sure what you were saying. 

Can you resubmit the document so it's all readable?

Also, you should schedule a time to connect via Zoom so I can help clarify things from previous labs and make sure you're setup to do the future labs, especially getting your Rocky server up and running. I hope to see you soon!
