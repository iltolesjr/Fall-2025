# Midterm Appeal — [Course Code and Section] — [Your Full Name]

Date: [Oct 17, 2025]
LMS: [D2L/Brightspace | Canvas | Blackboard]
Assessment: [Midterm Exam/Quiz name]

## Situation summary

- I opened the midterm and believed I could leave and return later.
- The instructions did not clearly state it was one attempt only (or this was not visible at the time).
- I exited expecting to resume, but the attempt auto-submitted/locked and the grade posted as 0.

## Goal

Politely request a reset, a reopened attempt, or an alternate make‑up, citing the instructions visibility issue and demonstrating good faith.

Subject: Midterm attempt locked at 0 — request for consideration

Dear [Professor/Instructor Last Name],

I’m writing about the [Midterm name] for [Course Code and Section] taken on [date]. I opened the exam and believed I would be able to leave and resume within the availability window. The instructions on my screen did not indicate (or were not clearly visible to me) that there was only one attempt.

When I exited to return later, the attempt locked and posted a 0. I understand exam settings are important, and I take responsibility for not completing it in one sitting. Given the confusion around the attempt limit display, would you consider one of the following options?

1) Reopen/reset the attempt so I can complete it once
2) Provide a make‑up or equivalent assessment
3) Apply partial credit for the work completed if any progress was recorded

I’ve included helpful details below to assist your decision:

- Timestamp I started the exam: [time]
- Availability window shown: [start–end]
- What I saw about attempts/time limit: [screenshot or note]
- My plan to avoid this in the future: complete high‑stakes assessments in a single uninterrupted session unless otherwise stated

If allowable by course policy, I’m available to complete the assessment by [date/time]. Thank you for considering this request. I appreciate your help and understand if policies limit options, but wanted to reach out promptly and transparently.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Student ID]
