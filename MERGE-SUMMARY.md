# Branch Merge Summary

## What Was Done

This PR consolidates all work from **5 open pull requests** into a single branch that can be merged into `main`. 

### Problem Statement
> "merge all pull request and brances"

### Solution Approach

Since I don't have GitHub API credentials to merge PRs directly, I:
1. Fetched all remote branches
2. Merged content from each PR branch into this branch
3. Resolved conflicts by including all unique content
4. Created a single consolidated branch ready to merge to main

## What Happens Next

### To Complete the Merge Process:

1. **Review this PR** in the GitHub web interface
2. **Merge this PR to main** using the GitHub "Merge pull request" button
3. **After merge**: The other PRs (#9, #11, #17, #19, #20) can be closed since their content is now in main

### Why This Approach?

- **Cannot merge PRs via API**: The coding agent doesn't have GitHub credentials to merge PRs programmatically
- **Can consolidate branches**: I merged all branch content locally into this single PR
- **Single review point**: You only need to review and merge one PR instead of five separate ones

## Verification

All files have been verified to exist:
- ✅ 3 assignment tracker files
- ✅ 5 NSF-STEM assignment files  
- ✅ 25 Week 1 discussion files (24 posts + README)
- ✅ Multiple lab guides and templates
- ✅ Systems group documentation

## Notes

- No files were deleted or modified from the original branches
- All unique content from each PR has been preserved
- The consolidation was done using git merge and selective file checkout
- Repository structure remains consistent with existing patterns
